"A Bibliometric Methodology to Unveil Territorial Inequities in the Scientific Wealth to Combat COVID-19","In this paper we develop a methodology to assess the scientific wealth of territories at field level. Our methodology uses a bibliometric approach based on the observation of academic research performance and overall scientific production in each territory. We apply it to assess disparities in the Italian territories in the medical specialties at the front line of the COVID-19 emergency. Italy has been the first among western countries to be severely affected by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study reveals remarkable inequities across territories, with scientific weaknesses concentrated in the south. Policies for rebalancing the north–south divide should also consider, in addition to tangible assets, the gap in production and availability of quality medical knowledge.","","Abramo G,D'Angelo CA","","2021","6601–6624","10.1007/s11192-021-04017-7","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1007/s11192-021-04017-7;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-021-04017-7","Journal Article"
"A Canonical Action Research Approach to the Effective Diffusion of Information Security with Social Network Analysis","As modern organisations are using strategic information systems as their competitive advantage, the management of information security IS is regarded as a top priority. However, technical measures are no longer sufficient for protecting IS, and the prevalence of centralised IS controls and top-down approach in IS management are challenged by the dynamic socio-organisational environment. In this article, a canonical action research CAR project discusses the use of social network analysis SNA methods to design and implement a cascading IS training/diffusion, which leveraged the social dynamics in the workplace to enhance the IS-related interactions between the employees in a large construction organisation in Southeast Asia. Through the enhanced IS interactions, which involved the employees' provisions of IS resources and IS influence, results indicated an improvement in the employees' attitudes towards IS. The research outcomes advocated the effective use of SNA methods, in combination with the CAR approach, which included the network metrics and means to select the suitable champions for the diffusion of IS, as well as to measure the diffusion effectiveness. Future directions to develop new IS-related network theories and apply SNA methods to study other IS concepts are also discussed.","","Pittayachawan S,Thien DD,Kautz K,Bruno V","","2017","22–43","10.4018/IJSS.2017070103","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.4018/IJSS.2017070103;http://dx.doi.org/10.4018/IJSS.2017070103","Journal Article"
"A Characterization of Digital Native Approaches To Mobile Privacy and Security","Despite their familiarity with the digital, so-called 'digital natives' are not tech-savvy, particularly with respect to privacy and security. In this study we characterize this problem by looking at a cohort of South African students. We employ a web-based survey of 100 students, supplemented by in-depth interviews with 10 additional students. In both cases we inquired about, and observed knowledge of permissions, encryption and application installation practices. Our findings show that most students (80%) do not look for or understand permissions or encryption, and use location-based services unsafely. Based on these results we argue that digital natives lack the technical skills and understanding to properly engage with mobile privacy and security. We further argue that this generation has been so over-exposed to mobile requests that violate their privacy and security that they have become desensitized and their definition of privacy and security has changed. Lastly, we discuss the implications of our findings for higher education institutions, policy, and mobile application design.","","Till S,Densmore M","","2019","","10.1145/3351108.3351131","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3351108.3351131;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3351108.3351131","Conference Paper"
"A Framework for Predicting Droughts in Developing Countries Using Sensor Networks and Mobile Phones","Drought is the most complex and least understood of all natural disasters and it affects more people than any other hazard. Droughts have become synonymous with the developing countries and in particular the Sub-Saharan Africa where the hazard is chronic. Effects of droughts can be mitigated if accurate and timely drought predications were to be done. Unfortunately, despite the enormous advancements in science, predictions only provide indications of trends. A major weakness of the existing tools is the emphasis on macro/international level information. The tools also tend to ignore the at risk community who happen to be host to very crucial traditional knowledge on droughts. In this paper, we propose an integrated drought predication framework that considers both scientific and traditional knowledge and combines the use of mobile phones with wireless sensor networks to be able to capture and relay micro drought parameters. The framework is an enhancement of ITU's Ubiquitous Sensor Network (USN) Layers. In order to accommodate the diverse roles mobile phones play in our framework, Layer 2 (USN Access Networking) is implemented using three sub-layers composed of heterogeneous gateways.","","Masinde M,Bagula A","","2010","390–393","10.1145/1899503.1899551","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/1899503.1899551;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1899503.1899551","Conference Paper"
"A Macro-Micro Weakly-Supervised Framework for AS-OCT Tissue Segmentation","Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) is the leading cause of irreversible blindness among Asian people. Early detection of PACG is essential, so as to provide timely treatment and minimize the vision loss. In the clinical practice, PACG is diagnosed by analyzing the angle between the cornea and iris with anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT). The rapid development of deep learning technologies provides the feasibility of building a computer-aided system for the fast and accurate segmentation of cornea and iris tissues. However, the application of deep learning methods in the medical imaging field is still restricted by the lack of enough fully-annotated samples. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to segment the target tissues accurately for the AS-OCT images, by using the combination of weakly-annotated images (majority) and fully-annotated images (minority). The proposed framework consists of two models which provide reliable guidance for each other. In addition, uncertainty guided strategies are adopted to increase the accuracy and stability of the guidance. Detailed experiments on the publicly available AGE dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art semi-/weakly-supervised methods and has a comparable performance as the fully-supervised method. Therefore, the proposed method is demonstrated to be effective in exploiting information contained in the weakly-annotated images and has the capability to substantively relieve the annotation workload.","","Ning M,Bian C,Lu D,Zhou HY,Yu S,Yuan C,Guo Y,Wang Y,Ma K,Zheng Y","","2020","725–734","10.1007/978-3-030-59722-1_70","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1007/978-3-030-59722-1_70;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-59722-1_70","Conference Paper"
"A Metric Space for Point Process Excitations","A multivariate Hawkes process enables self- and cross-excitations through a triggering matrix that behaves like an asymmetrical covariance structure, characterizing pairwise interactions between the event types. Full-rank estimation of all interactions is often infeasible in empirical settings. Models that specialize on a spatiotemporal application alleviate this obstacle by exploiting spatial locality, allowing the dyadic relationships between events to depend only on separation in time and relative distances in real Euclidean space. Here we generalize this framework to any multivariate Hawkes process, and harness it as a vessel for embedding arbitrary event types in a hidden metric space. Specifically, we propose a Hidden Hawkes Geometry (HHG) model to uncover the hidden geometry between event excitations in a multivariate point process. The low dimensionality of the embedding regularizes the structure of the inferred interactions. We develop a number of estimators and validate the model by conducting several experiments. In particular, we investigate regional infectivity dynamics of COVID-19 in an early South Korean record and recent Los Angeles confirmed cases. By additionally performing synthetic experiments on short records as well as explorations into options markets and the Ebola epidemic, we demonstrate that learning the embedding alongside a point process uncovers salient interactions in a broad range of applications.","","Marmarelis MG,Ver Steeg G,Galstyan A","","2022","","10.1613/jair.1.13610","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1613/jair.1.13610;http://dx.doi.org/10.1613/jair.1.13610","Journal Article"

"A Neural Network-Based Point Registration Method for 3D Rigid Face Image","Intelligent detection of human face image combined with the real-time video monitoring has been applied to improve the secure and protective possibility. The registration is an indispensible step before distinguishing the variation among the images. Neural network (NN) has a strong learning ability from a mass unstructured point cloud even containing noisy data. Neural network has been applied to register 3D reconstructed ear data and 3D surface of bunny and to achieve the better results. Motivated by this idea, NN-based registration method for 3D rigid face image is proposed. This paper presented the proof process of obtaining rotation matrix and translation vector according to the training process of neural network. Then the measure index of registration performance was provided. The elaborate experiments were conducted on the 3D USF face database (provided by the University of South Florida) to verify the effectiveness of neural network as a registration method. Next, two comparisons were performed, one group was NN-based and ICP-based registration methods and the other group was our proposed NN-based and other NN-based registration methods. The experimental results showed that neural network is a robust and potential registration method for rigid face image registration. Furthermore, our proposed NN-based registration method is extended easily to do 2D-to-3D registration and non-rigid face registration.","","Chen J,Liao IY,Belaton B,Zaman M","","2015","197–214","10.1007/s11280-013-0213-9","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1007/s11280-013-0213-9;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11280-013-0213-9","Journal Article"
"A New Assessment Model for Evacuation Vulnerability in Urban Areas","In the high-speed urbanization process of China, the urban population has been increasing significantly, leading to a high-density aggregation of population. However, the sharp increase in population density has not produced commensurate improvements in the road networks. On the contrary, the population increase induced a serious evacuation vulnerability, which cities experience during various hazards and catastrophic events. Therefore, research on evacuation vulnerability is important to urban planning. To assess the evacuation vulnerability, the optimal and worst scenarios should be considered because all possible evacuation plans occur between these extremes. However, most previous evacuation vulnerability studies are based on the worst-case scenario, only providing an upper bound of a potential evacuation assessment. To provide a more comprehensive theoretical basis for decision-makers to understand the consequences caused by all possible evacuations, this paper proposes an optimal evacuation vulnerability assessment model that provides the lower bound on potential evacuation difficulties. The model is solved by a stepwise spreading algorithm based on Graph Theory. Subsequently, to evaluate the effectiveness of the model, the study adopts the model to assess the evacuation capability of different road network topologies. A comparison with previous research was performed. The model was demonstrated in an application to the South Luogu Alley of Beijing, China. The significance of this paper is that the combination of our model with previous research may provide a more complete theoretical basis for an evacuation vulnerability assessment.","","Ma X,Pei T,Song C,Zhou C","","2016","2401–2420","","","Journal Article"
"A New Method for Pricing Interest-Rate Derivatives in Fixed Income Markets","We devised a method for pricing path dependent derivatives whose theory is new. It is based on a time and value discretization of the interest rate process, in conjunction with prices of Arrow-Debreu securities with unitary lifetime obtained via the Feymann-Kac formula. Such theoretical framework boils down immediately to allowing parallel computing, a quality that is not present in standard methods exploiting PDEs. It operates with a broad range of diffusions and quite general payoffs. Actually, the unique version of the method equally applies to stock and fixed income markets. An exercise is performed through pricing an Asian interest rate option. We purposely kept focus in the interest rate scenario since they are typically associated to the range of low volatilities where the existing numerical methods fail.","","Baczynski J,Otazú JB,Vicente JV","","2017","3057–3062","10.1109/CDC.2017.8264105","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1109/CDC.2017.8264105;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2017.8264105","Conference Paper"
"A Proposal for Coalition Networking in Dynamic Operational Environments","At present, military communications within battlefields are very restricted, both by policy and due to technology limitations. In Southwest Asia today, there are needlessly long and complex communications paths, often involving multiple relays and use of constrained-bandwidth MILSATCOM back-haul outside the theatre, when nearby forces could communicate directly via existing interoperable radios. This is a current problem for NATO and Coalition forces. The current Internet Protocol suite lacks core support for mobility, scalable support for multi-homed nodes, and does not provide the capabilities needed for optimal communications in forward operating areas.We propose a coalition-based, multi-homed approach leveraging both local-area and wide-area connectivity, improving both the flexibility and robustness of communication, without conflicting with the security policy of sensitive communication. The Coalition Peering Domain (CPD), is a distributed, self-configuring architecture that supports the secure, collaborative networking relationships needed to provide this flexibility and robustness. The CPD facilitates the inter-connection of cooperating, but administratively separate, network segments. The CPD exploits multihomed and multi-path communication to better-utilise all available connectivity. The Identifier-Locator Network Protocol (ILNP) provides native support for improved scalability in multi-homing and mobility, while easing use of network layer security and allowing inter-operation across different administrative domains. Our approach is compatible with current work in Mobile Ad-Hoc Networking (MANET). ILNP has excellent compatibility with IPv6: existing IPv6 backbone networks do not require any modification to carry ILNP traffic natively. There are practical, realistic and deployable engineering solutions to realise the CPD and ILNP within the framework of IPv6.","","Atkinson R,Lad M,Bhatti S,Hailes S","","2006","788–795","","","Conference Paper"
"A Proposal of Metrics for Botnet Detection Based on Its Cooperative Behavior","In this paper, we propose three metrics for detecting botnets through analyzing their behavior. Our social infrastructure (i.e., the Internet) is currently experiencing the danger of bots' malicious activities as the scale of botnets increases. Although it is imperative to detect botnet to help protect computers from attacks, effective metrics for botnet detection have not been adequately researched. In this work we measure enormous amounts of traffic passing through the Asian Internet Interconnection Initiatives (AIII) infrastructure. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed metrics, we analyze measured traffic in three experiments. The experimental results reveal that our metrics are applicable for detecting botnets, but further research is needed to refine their performance.","","Akiyama M,Kawamoto T,Shimamura M,Yokoyama T,Kadobayashi Y,Yamaguchi S","","2007","82","10.1109/SAINT-W.2007.14","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1109/SAINT-W.2007.14;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SAINT-W.2007.14","Conference Paper"
"A Simple Model to Assess the Sensitivity of Grassland Dairy Systems to Scenarios of Seasonal Biomass Production Variability","Highlights We model a dairy cattle farming system feeding almost exclusively on grass in France. A model was developed with some interactions with advisers and could be used by them. The model is used to understand sensitivity and adaptive capacities of the systems. The amount of forage bought was not only explained by the forage autonomy of farms. Farms with high forage autonomy can resist to repeated biomass growth variability. In recent decades, dairy herds of the peri-Mediterranean area have coped with high climatic variability, which has contributed to weakening their economic equilibrium. Survey studies highlighted that climatic impact depends on the strategies of farmers, related to forage autonomy. To explain this observation precisely and assess the opportunity of changing forage strategy as an adaptation to cope with climatic variability over the long term, a simulator was developed to explore the impact of several biomass production variability scenarios on forage purchases. This approach was applied on dairy cattle farms in a mountain area in the South of France (Ardèche), with forage systems based on grass (hay and pasture), using several levels of forage autonomy. A computer application was developed through a partnership project between our research team and officers of an extension board. We then validated the ability of the simulator to account for the operation of special cases of farms after calibration and studied the model sensitivity to key parameter variations. Then we explored (i) how the simulator can be used to assess the sensitivity of six dairy farms to biomass production variability and (ii) the value of an adaptation strategy with advance forage stockpiling. The sensitivity analysis highlights that the purchase of forage was highly sensitive to production variation during March, April and May. The farms which used grazing the most, exhibited a lower standard deviation than the other farms. Variation obtained for the standard deviation of forage bought was not only explained by the forage autonomy but might depend on other characteristics such as time of turnout and surface allocation. The succession of disadvantageous years was tested. The decrease in the stock differed according to the forage autonomy of farms. Whereas farms which were only just autonomous bought forage as of the first disadvantageous year, farms with forage autonomy of 120% can resist repeated biomass production variability for 8years with the constitution of remaining stocks of forage. The simulator developed here is simple enough both to explore the sensitivity of a dairy system and promote the debate on the results with farmers and advisers.","","Lurette A,Aubron C,Moulin CH","","2013","27–36","","","Journal Article"
"A Statistical Approach Towards Fraud Detection in the Horse Racing","With the inception of online betting in S. Korea, various foreigner professional gambling groups have exploited the betting regulations. This phenomenon has occurred mainly in Asia, because the regulations on gambling in these countries are complex and robust. Our study focuses on the horse racing in S. Korea, which is operated under the government funding. The foreigner gambling groups tried unlimited betting by modifying the official IoT (Internet of Things) based APP arbitrarily. We have checked that some abnormal transactions can occur by modifying this application. Our study proposes a fraud detection method that can help detecting abnormal activities and prevent them. Currently, the Korea Racing Authority (KRA) has been criticized for being ill-equipped to detect abnormal activities with the Walkerhill Incident. Our study presents a new anomaly detection model that uses a flexible window. In this study, we propose an idea that aims to detect abnormal betting transactions.","","Min M,Lee JJ,Park H,Shin H,Lee K","","2020","191–202","10.1007/978-3-030-65299-9_15","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1007/978-3-030-65299-9_15;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-65299-9_15","Conference Paper"
"A Strategic Framework for a Secure Cyberspace in Developing Countries with Special Emphasis on the Risk of Cyber Warfare","The objective of this paper is to provide a strategic framework for a secure cyberspace in developing countries, taking cognisance of the realities and constraints within a developing milieu; and to discuss if the risk of cyber warfare and related techniques against developing countries should be addressed within 'The Framework'. Cybersecurity policies and related strategies are required for developing countries in order to effectively safeguard against cyber related threats the same as for developed countries. These policies and strategies for developing countries will differ from those of developed countries due to the unique realities within a developing world. Africa in specific is presently seen as a hotbed for cybercrime, and one of the reasons is that many African countries do not have a proper framework, policies and procedures to properly protect cyberspace. Experience has also shown that a pure adoption by developing countries of the cyber frameworks of developed nations will not always be effective, especially due to the unique requirements and realities within developing worlds, such as limited resources, infrastructure, technologies, skills and experience. It is also necessary when talking about a strategic framework to secure cyberspace, to discuss cyber warfare, its general application and its possible utilisation as part of the strategy to protect national critical information infrastructure. This, as part of a developing country's national security strategy in addition to traditional cybersecurity defence measures. The approach taken for the research program, and discussed in this paper, is based on a comprehensive literature study on several existing cybersecurity policies and strategies from both developed and developing countries. From this the drivers / elements for national cybersecurity policies and strategies were identified. These drivers were than adapted to specifically relate to the requirements of developing countries, and then, utilising the identified and adapted drivers, our strategic framework for developing countries to secure their cyberspace was developed. This document will be very useful for those African countries venturing into defining relevant policies and procedures.","","Jaquire V,von Solms B","","2015","1–18","10.4018/IJCWT.2015010101","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.4018/IJCWT.2015010101;http://dx.doi.org/10.4018/IJCWT.2015010101","Journal Article"
"A Study of MVNO Diffusion and Market Structure in the EU, US, Hong Kong, and Singapore","Mobile virtual network operators (MVNO's) are emerging as alternative channels for network operators to increase market share and drive traffic over their networks. MVNO's have gained popularity recently in Europe, but have a dismal track record in Asia. In comparing the two regions, this study analyzes how the MVNO market has changed and what opportunities and/or threats network operators and potential MVNO entrants are likely to face. The essential question in next generation MVNO's is how the roles of mobile network operators, service providers and content producers will change current and future value chains. This study conducts an economic assessment of market structure and environment for different countries' MVNO diffusion. The data on market structure is analyzed by means of factor analysis techniques in order to group countries according to their market environments. Then, structural equation modeling is used to investigate the relations of MVNO diffusion and independent variables. The results show that the MVNO diffusion significantly relates to market and industry structure.","","Shin DH,Bartolacci M","","2007","86–100","10.1016/j.tele.2005.11.003","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1016/j.tele.2005.11.003;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tele.2005.11.003","Journal Article"
"A Study on Factors Affecting the Adoption of LTE Mobile Communication Service: The Case of South Korea","Smartphones have a big advantage making infinite expandability possible by downloading new applications consistently through application store. These new devices provide us with multimedia features such as high quality voice calls, listening to music, and internet searching while previously cell phone just executed functions of voice calls, SMS, and PDA. So, recently people's interest in mobile communication service is on the increase. When 3G service reached the boundary of its capacity due to increase of continuous data volume, LTE and LTE-A was commercialized and is being used. The goal of this study is to find factors affecting the intention to adopt LTE service through a survey conducted in South Korea. The present study focused on the functional dimension including cost, speed, and security, the social dimension including social influence, and the personal dimension including personal innovativeness and self-efficacy to find out their effects on intention to accept LTE service. As a result, our study showed the cost and speed of LTE service were not significant variables. Also, there were no differences between the effects of perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and perceived enjoyment on intention to use LTE service.","","Park ST,Im H,Noh KS","","2016","217–237","10.1007/s11277-015-2802-7","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1007/s11277-015-2802-7;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11277-015-2802-7","Journal Article"

"A Systematic Mapping about User Sensitive Information on Social Networks","Social networks are used by millions of users every day and become part of our lives. However, privacy and security issues have been raised since user's sensitive information are exposed by several manners. User's sensitive information disclosure is not solved yet by current social networks. Thus several researches have been done in order to understand implications and users awareness. Different approaches and techniques are applied on every study resulting a heterogeneous set of information. In order to better understand the current state of the literature about user's privacy disclosure and security we conducted a review of published papers on IEEE, ACM and Science Direct using a systematic mapping. We evaluated 143 papers and classified 35 under our defined criteria to consider only studies with experiment on user privacy and security disclosure. Results indicate an academic preference to conduct questionnaire approaches aiming to explore user's awareness. We also notice that most of studies are limited to small groups and that research community is basically restricted to USA, Europe and Asia.","","Jasinski MG,Oliveira HC,Sartori DF,Berkenbrock CD","","2015","76–81","10.1109/CISIS.2015.11","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1109/CISIS.2015.11;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CISIS.2015.11","Conference Paper"
"A Systems Approach in Examining Optimization Opportunities and Dynamics of the Global Steel Industry","This paper takes a systems perspective in exploring and analyzing optimization possibilities and market dynamics of the global steel industry. To assess and improve this industry's performance, two analytical approaches are used. First, a multiple regression analysis was applied to determine the important relationships among world crude steel producers, international trading blocs and key countries to quantify the historical correlations in the steel industry. Next, game theory models are applied to study global steel industry dynamics and to quantify and compare historical production data in order to determine optimal approaches that could be employed to gain market share by key countries and players. In order to gain an in-depth understanding of interplay among various system's players within this complex global steel industry, the paper discusses protectionism, quotas, tariffs, exports, imports, capacity, substitution, specialization, mergers and cooperation, among other strategies used historically within the industry. A geographical survey of the global steel industry data is presented in multiple chart formats. Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats to the industry players are compared. Implications of the analytical findings for the US, European, and Asian competitors in the global steel industry are outlined and recommendations that would lead to optimization of global steel industry operations are suggested.","","Kumar S,Ghildayal N,Ostor C","","2008","401–427","","","Journal Article"

"Adaptive Stochastic Weak Approximation of Degenerate Parabolic Equations of Kolmogorov Type","Degenerate parabolic equations of Kolmogorov type occur in many areas of analysis and applied mathematics. In their simplest form these equations were introduced by Kolmogorov in 1934 to describe the probability density of the positions and velocities of particles but the equations are also used as prototypes for evolution equations arising in the kinetic theory of gases. More recently equations of Kolmogorov type have also turned out to be relevant in option pricing in the setting of certain models for stochastic volatility and in the pricing of Asian options. The purpose of this paper is to numerically solve the Cauchy problem, for a general class of second order degenerate parabolic differential operators of Kolmogorov type with variable coefficients, using a posteriori error estimates and an algorithm for adaptive weak approximation of stochastic differential equations. Furthermore, we show how to apply these results in the context of mathematical finance and option pricing. The approach outlined in this paper circumvents many of the problems confronted by any deterministic approach based on, for example, a finite-difference discretization of the partial differential equation in itself. These problems are caused by the fact that the natural setting for degenerate parabolic differential operators of Kolmogorov type is that of a Lie group much more involved than the standard Euclidean Lie group of translations, the latter being relevant in the case of uniformly elliptic parabolic operators.","","Frentz M,Nyström K","","2010","146–164","10.1016/j.cam.2009.12.011","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1016/j.cam.2009.12.011;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cam.2009.12.011","Journal Article"
"Affordable System for Rapid Detection and Mitigation of Emerging Diseases","South and South-East Asian countries are currently in the midst of a new epidemic of Dengue Fever. This paper presents disease surveillance systems in Sri Lanka and India, monitoring a handful of communicable diseases termed as notifiable. These systems typically require 15-30 days to communicate field data to the central Epidemiology Units, to be then manually processed Prashant & Waidyanatha, 2010. Currently used analyses rely on aggregating counts of notifiable disease cases by district, disease, and week. The Real-Time Biosurveillance Program RTBP, a multi-partner initiative, aims at addressing those challenges by developing affordable paradigm-changing Information Communication Technology ICT, implementing and field-testing them in India and Sri Lanka. Key components of the proposed solution include real-time digitization of clinical information at hospitals and clinics with the mHealthSurvey mobile phone software Kannan et al., 2010, detecting anomalies in large multivariate biosurveillance data using the T-Cube Web Interface spatio-temporal statistical analysis tool Ray et al., 2008, and disseminating critical information pertaining to the adverse events to healthcare workers using the Sahana Alerting Module Sampath et al., 2010. This paper provides an overview of the applications and discusses utility of the technologies for real-time detection and mitigation of emerging threats to public health.","","Waidyanatha N,Dubrawski A,M.

"Agents for the Masses?","Agent technology is in a state of paradox. The field has never enjoyed more energy and concomitant research progress, and yet the rate of uptake of new research results in fielded systems has been glacially slow. The few agents in the real world of everyday applications generate more heat than enlightenment; most are easily confused, few collaborate except in trivial prearranged fashion, and all enjoy little freedom of movement. Significantly, the current trapped state of our agents has less to do with lack of mobility mechanisms than with their unpreparedness to work fully in the open world of cyberspace and to interoperate outside of a tightly circumscribed sphere of agent platforms and domains. The kinds of agents that we want-citizens of the wired world, equipped with stamped passports and Berlitz travelers guides explaining foreign phrases and places that allow them to hail, meet, and greet agents of any sort in the open landscape of the Internet and, if not able to team up on a project, at least able to ask intelligibly for directions-these kinds of agents, alas, exist today only in our imaginations (and, of course, in the vision sections of our research proposals).Actually building the sophisticated agent-based systems of the future will require research advances on at least three fronts: We must continue work on agent theory so that many currently unanswered questions about the scope and limitations of alternative approaches to agent design can be addressed. We must make agent frameworks and infrastructure powerful, interoperable, and secure enough to support robust large-scale coordinated problem-solving activity.Perhaps more importantly, we must develop new sorts of tools to help nonspecialists unlock the power of agent technology.The good news is that things are progressing well on the first two fronts. Various initiatives are beginning to provide an early preview of the faster, more reliable, and more secure versions of the next-generation Internet that our large-scale visions require. Middleware and Internet technologies and standards are now maturing to the point that agent framework developers can rely on off-the-shelf products as a ready substrate to their own work, rather than creating ad hoc alternatives from scratch. Advances in the difficult theoretical issues of dynamic agent communication, coordination, and control are beginning to let us better understand how to deploy large numbers of agents with confidence. Finally, recent work in theory and infrastructure has yielded exciting new kinds of blueprints for future systems that lie beyond the evolutionary development of current technologies. From grids to Jini (http://java.sun.com/products/jini), these approaches aim to provide a universal source of dynamically pluggable, pervasive, and dependable computing power, while guaranteeing levels of security and quality of service that will make new classes of agent applications possible.However, a large and ugly chasm still separates the world of formal theory and infrastructure from the world of practical nuts-and-bolts agent-system development-this is where the third research front comes in. If agent technology is ever to become as widely used as ordinary object technology is today, we must create new sorts of tools to help non-guru developers bridge the gaps between theory, plumbing, and practice. Currently, full appreciation of leading-edge developments in agent theory and frameworks requires sophisticated knowledge of speech-act theory, formal semantics, linguistic pragmatics, logic, security design, Internet and middleware technologies, distributed computing, planning, and other disciplines that are not likely to be present in a typical developer's skill set. Without good tools, rapid advances in theory and infrastructure might paradoxically attenuate rather than accelerate the adoption of agent technology as members of the developer community spin their wheels or ultimately give up in disgust. Hence we must ask: Is it possible to make development of sophisticated agents simple enough to be practical?Fortunately, the agents community has not completely neglected the question of tools. The DARPA CoABS program and complementary initiatives in Europe and Asia are vigorously supporting research to accelerate the development of scalable interoperable agent theory and tools, and are promoting the eventual adoption of standards through bodies such as FIPA. As part of these efforts, we are working to extend theory and create tools in two areas: agent communication and agent management. This article discusses our current research directions and preliminary results in each of these areas.","","Bradshaw JM,Greaves M,Holmback H,Karygiannis T,Jansen W,Silverman BG,Suri N,Wong A","","1999","53–63","10.1109/5254.757632","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1109/5254.757632;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/5254.757632","Journal Article"
"All Things Considered: An Analysis of IoT Devices on Home Networks","In this paper, we provide the first large-scale empirical analysis of IoT devices in real-world homes by leveraging data collected from user-initiated network scans of 83M devices in 16M households. We find that IoT adoption is widespread: on several continents, more than half of households already have at least one IoT device. Device types and manufacturer popularity vary dramatically across regions. For example, while nearly half of North American homes have an Internet-connected television or streaming device, less than three percent do in South Asia where the majority of devices are surveillance cameras. We investigate the security posture of devices, detailing their open services, weak default credentials, and vulnerability to known attacks. Device security similarly varies geographically, even for specific manufacturers. For example, while less than 17% of TP-Link home routers in North America have guessable passwords, nearly half do in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. We argue that IoT devices are here, but for most homes, the types of devices adopted are not the ones actively discussed. We hope that by shedding light on this complex ecosystem, we help the security community develop solutions that are applicable to today's homes.","","Kumar D,Shen K,Case B,Garg D,Alperovich G,Kuznetsov D,Kuznetsov D,Gupta R,Durumeric Z","","2019","1169–1185","","","Conference Paper"
"An Accelerating Quasi-Monte Carlo Method for Option Pricing Under the Generalized Hyperbolic Lévy Process","In this paper, we develop a simple and yet practically efficient algorithm for simulating high-dimensional exotic options. Our method is based on an extension of Imai and Tan's linear transformation method, which is originally proposed in the context of simulating a Gaussian process. By generalizing this method to other stochastic processes and exploiting the numerical inversion method of Hormann and Leydold, this method can be used to enhance quasi-Monte Carlo method in a wide range of applications. We demonstrate the relative efficiency of our proposed simulation technique using exotic option examples including Asian, lookback, barrier, and cliquet options for which the underlying asset price follows an exponential generalized hyperbolic Lévy process. We also illustrate the impact of our proposed method on dimension reduction.","","Imai J,Tan KS","","2009","2282–2302","10.1137/080727713","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1137/080727713;http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/080727713","Journal Article"

"An E-Store Developing Model for Minimizing the Impact of Procedural and Cultural Change within an Enterprise","Abstract: Internet, Value Added Network (VAN) and Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) had revolutionized global trade and services. We have emerged to a new experience of global virtual market where trading could be carried out in cyberspace. As electronic markets are possible for small and large enterprises competing as equal players, Business-to- business (B2B) and Business-to-Consumers (B2C) via electronic Commerce (e-Commerce) systems operating on Internet are producing profound changes in enterprise culture on a global basis. Financial institutions and retail business in Asia are believed to be falling far behind the US and Europe when it comes to using the Internet for business. Despite the cultural and environmental differences in marketing between west and east, this reality has provided a vision for the second generation of e-Commerce application developers to learn the issues that had been experienced by these pioneer companies whom had participated in e-Commerce for a while. Indeed, over the heat of e-Commerce, companies are now thinking big and acting small in developing their e-Commerce applications. They are willing to tactfully slow down their pace in transforming business to electronic-Business (e-Business) via BPR (Business Process Reengineering). Investing extra time and cost in securing their business, instead of getting into premature commitment in e-business applications development which is not going to last long or with huge difficulties in maintenance. This paper provide an outline of our investigation on the issues in developing e-stores and identified the crucial constitution in developing a successful e-Commerce system while proposing a model for traditional industry to establish its electronic or virtual stores. We analyze the development process between traditional and electronic stores to help business to plan on new process. The contribution of this research is a novel approach embedded in a unique model for establishing e-stores (electronic Stores). This model is intended to allow enterprises to establish and manage their e-stores as if they are managing their conventional stores. As such the impact of cultural and logistic changes within an enterprise is minimized. With the length of this paper, the outline of this framework model is presented.","","Kwan IS","","2001","79","","","Conference Paper"
"An Empirical Analysis of ZeuS C&C Lifetime","Botnets continue to pose a significant threat to network-based applications and communications over the Internet. A key mitigation strategy has been to take down command and control infrastructure of the botnets. The efficiency of those mitigation methods has not been extensively studied. In this paper we investigate several observable characteristics of botnet command and controls (C&C) and estimate the variability in the survival rate of these C&Cs and the factors that are related to such variability. Furthermore, we show that different type of mitigation efforts have different impact. Kaplan-Meier analysis is performed to evaluate C&C survival ratios in the particular case of the ZeuS botnet. Using a lasso penalized Cox regression model, we identify the factors that influence the lifetime of a C&C. Location, malware family type, registrar, hosting type and popularity are the fundamental factors that explain this variability. Our results show that location and type of hosting are the two factors that affect more significantly the C&C lifetime. Thus, ZeuS C&Cs in certain regions of Asia are prone to stay online longer that those located in Europe.","","Gañán C,Cetin O,van Eeten M","","2015","97–108","10.1145/2714576.2714579","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/2714576.2714579;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2714576.2714579","Conference Paper"
"An Enhanced Dust Index for Asian Dust Detection with MODIS Images","An enhanced dust index EDI for Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS solar reflectance bands is proposed that provides a means to detect the dust status of the atmosphere. The EDI utilizes only solar reflectance channels and may therefore be applied consistently to the entire MODIS time series records 1999 to present for daytime dust observation, producing a higher spatial resolution 500 m dust result than that from thermal-infrared records 1000 m, which were developed previously and are currently being used. The index introduces dust optical density α, which can be simply estimated by spectral unmixing, into the normalized difference between reflectance at near-infrared 2.13 μm and blue 0.469 μm. Dust severity can thus be rated from weak to severe within a standard range of –1 to 1. The index was applied to 11 typical dust events during 2000–2010 in East Asia, where it showed good coherence with meteorological station-observed visibility R2 = 0.7909, p < 0.05 and standardized visibility R2 = 0.7128, p < 0.05. Further comparison with the commonly used normalized difference dust index NDDI and brightness temperature difference BTD between MODIS bands 31 and 32 also indicated a better performance of the EDI in identifying the spatial and density distributions of dust. Previously applied satellite-based dust indices, particularly for the visible and near-infrared, can therefore be improved for a better quantification of dust aerosols.","","Han L,Tsunekawa A,Tsubo M,Zhou W","","2013","6484–6495","10.1080/01431161.2013.802055","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1080/01431161.2013.802055;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2013.802055","Journal Article"
"An Expectation-Confirmation Model of Continuance Intention to Use Mobile Instant Messaging","We examined the factors that affect users' continuance intention to use mobile instant messaging.We expanded the ECM to cover the context of post-consumption stage for MIM services.We redefined perceived usability in the context of mobile instant messaging. Stiff competition in the mobile instant messaging (MIM) market underscores the importance of continuance use of MIM to ensure sustainable growth of service providers. This paper investigates the impact of perceived usability, perceived security, perceived service quality, and confirmation on users' continuance intention to use MIM. A research model based on the expectation-confirmation model was built and empirically tested using data from 334 MIM users in South Korea. The results showed that perceived service quality and perceived usability significantly affect user satisfaction and continuance intention to use MIM. Perceived service quality also influences confirmation, which in turns affects perceived usability. The effect of perceived security on user satisfaction, however, is not significant. The findings provide insights to service providers when strategizing to increase customers' continuance intention to use MIM.","","Oghuma AP,Libaque-Saenz CF,Wong SF,Chang Y","","2016","34–47","10.1016/j.tele.2015.05.006","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1016/j.tele.2015.05.006;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tele.2015.05.006","Journal Article"

An application of the new algorithm results in the first-known near-practical key recovery attack on the shrinking generator with the parameters suggested by Krawczyk in 1994, which was verified in the 40-bit data LFSR case for which the only previously known efficient attacks were distinguishing attacks.","","Zhang B,Feng D","","2009","214–227","","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1007/978-3-642-04159-4_14","Book Chapter"
"An Integrated Approach to Map Certain Palaeochannels of South India Using Remote Sensing, Geophysics, and Sedimentological Techniques","Palaeochannels are important sources of groundwater, economic minerals, and placer deposits. They are also good repositories of palaeoclimate data. To exploit such resources, the first essential step would be to identify and map palaeochannels. This article presents a study in which multi-sensor optical, thermal, and microwave image data and satellite-derived digital elevation models DEMs of the northern coastal region of Tamilnadu state, south India, were analysed visually and digitally to recognize exposed and buried palaeochannels. Image-enhancement techniques such as linear contrast enhancement of optical data and fusion of microwave and optical image data brought out more information about the palaeochannels. Hill-shading techniques applied to the satellite-derived DEM, further added to the information content on the existence of the palaeochannels. The existence of the newly identified palaeochannels was verified by ground-based techniques such as field checks, sedimentological analysis, and electrical resistivity surveys. The presence of well sorted and rounded grains in the sediment samples and high apparent electrical resistivity values for the thick sandy subsurface strata in these locations confirmed the existence of palaeochannels which were interpreted from the images.","","Nandini CV,Sanjeevi S,Bhaskar AS","","2013","6507–6528","","","Journal Article"
"An Intelligent Approach Based on Cleaning up of Inutile Contents for Extremism Detection and Classification in Social Networks","Extremism is a growing threat worldwide that presents a significant danger to public safety and national security. Social networks provide extremists with spaces to spread their ideas through commentaries or tweets, often in Asian English. In this paper, we propose an intelligent approach that cleans the text’s content, analyzes its sentiment and extracts its features after converting it to digital data for machine learning treatments. We apply sixteen intelligent machine learning classifiers for extremism detection and classification. The proposed artificial intelligence methods for Asian English language data are used to extract the essential features from the text. Our evaluation of the proposed model with an extremism dataset proves its effectiveness compared to the standard classification models based on various performance metrics. The proposed model achieves (93,6% ) accuracy for extremism detection and (97,0% ) for extremism classification.","","Berhoum A,Meftah MC,Laouid A,Hammoudeh M","","2023","","10.1145/3575802","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3575802;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3575802","Journal Article"
"An Other-Race Effect for Face Recognition Algorithms","Psychological research indicates that humans recognize faces of their own race more accurately than faces of other races. This “other-race effect” occurs for algorithms tested in a recent international competition for state-of-the-art face recognition algorithms. We report results for a Western algorithm made by fusing eight algorithms from Western countries and an East Asian algorithm made by fusing five algorithms from East Asian countries. At the low false accept rates required for most security applications, the Western algorithm recognized Caucasian faces more accurately than East Asian faces and the East Asian algorithm recognized East Asian faces more accurately than Caucasian faces. Next, using a test that spanned all false alarm rates, we compared the algorithms with humans of Caucasian and East Asian descent matching face identity in an identical stimulus set. In this case, both algorithms performed better on the Caucasian faces—the “majority” race in the database. The Caucasian face advantage, however, was far larger for the Western algorithm than for the East Asian algorithm. Humans showed the standard other-race effect for these faces, but showed more stable performance than the algorithms over changes in the race of the test faces. State-of-the-art face recognition algorithms, like humans, struggle with “other-race face” recognition.","","Phillips PJ,Jiang F,Narvekar A,Ayyad J,O'Toole AJ","","2011","","10.1145/1870076.1870082","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/1870076.1870082;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1870076.1870082","Journal Article"
"Anonymity Preserving Byzantine Vector Consensus","Collecting anonymous opinions has applications from whistleblowing to complex voting where participants rank candidates by order of preferences. Unfortunately, as far as we know there is no efficient distributed solution to this problem. Previous solutions either require trusted third parties, are inefficient or sacrifice anonymity.In this paper, we propose a distributed solution called the Anonymised Vector Consensus Protocol (AVCP) that reduces the problem of agreeing on a set of anonymous votes to the binary Byzantine consensus problem. The key idea to preserve the anonymity of voters—despite some of them acting maliciously—is to detect double votes through traceable ring signatures. AVCP is resilient-optimal as it tolerates up to a third of Byzantine participants. We show that our algorithm is correct and that it preserves anonymity with at most a linear communication overhead and constant message overhead when compared to a recent consensus baseline. Finally, we demonstrate empirically that the protocol is practical by deploying it on 100 machines geo-distributed in three continents: America, Asia and Europe. Anonymous decisions are reached within 10 s with a conservative choice of traceable ring signatures.","","Cachin C,Collins D,Crain T,Gramoli V","","2020","133–152","10.1007/978-3-030-58951-6_7","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1007/978-3-030-58951-6_7;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-58951-6_7","Conference Paper"

"Artificial Neural Network Modeling and Cluster Analysis for Organic Facies and Burial History Estimation Using Well Log Data: A Case Study of the South Pars Gas Field, Persian Gulf, Iran","Intelligent and statistical techniques were used to extract the hidden organic facies from well log responses in the Giant South Pars Gas Field, Persian Gulf, Iran. Kazhdomi Formation of Mid-Cretaceous and Kangan-Dalan Formations of Permo-Triassic Data were used for this purpose. Initially GR, SGR, CGR, THOR, POTA, NPHI and DT logs were applied to model the relationship between wireline logs and Total Organic Carbon (TOC) content using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The correlation coefficient (R^2) between the measured and ANN predicted TOC equals to 89%. The performance of the model is measured by the Mean Squared Error function, which does not exceed 0.0073. Using Cluster Analysis technique and creating a binary hierarchical cluster tree the constructed TOC column of each formation was clustered into 5 organic facies according to their geochemical similarity. Later a second model with the accuracy of 84% was created by ANN to determine the specified clusters (facies) directly from well logs for quick cluster recognition in other wells of the studied field. Each created facies was correlated to its appropriate burial history curve. Hence each and every facies of a formation could be scrutinized separately and directly from its well logs, demonstrating the time and depth of oil or gas generation. Therefore potential production zone of Kazhdomi probable source rock and Kangan- Dalan reservoir formation could be identified while well logging operations (especially in LWD cases) were in progress. This could reduce uncertainty and save plenty of time and cost for oil industries and aid in the successful implementation of exploration and exploitation plans.","","Alizadeh B,Najjari S,Kadkhodaie-Ilkhchi A","","2012","261–269","10.1016/j.cageo.2011.11.024","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1016/j.cageo.2011.11.024;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2011.11.024","Journal Article"
"Assessing Gender Bias in Machine Translation: A Case Study with Google Translate","Recently there has been a growing concern in academia, industrial research laboratories and the mainstream commercial media about the phenomenon dubbed as machine bias, where trained statistical models—unbeknownst to their creators—grow to reflect controversial societal asymmetries, such as gender or racial bias. A significant number of Artificial Intelligence tools have recently been suggested to be harmfully biased toward some minority, with reports of racist criminal behavior predictors, Apple’s Iphone X failing to differentiate between two distinct Asian people and the now infamous case of Google photos’ mistakenly classifying black people as gorillas. Although a systematic study of such biases can be difficult, we believe that automated translation tools can be exploited through gender neutral languages to yield a window into the phenomenon of gender bias in AI. In this paper, we start with a comprehensive list of job positions from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and used it in order to build sentences in constructions like “He/She is an Engineer” (where “Engineer” is replaced by the job position of interest) in 12 different gender neutral languages such as Hungarian, Chinese, Yoruba, and several others. We translate these sentences into English using the Google Translate API, and collect statistics about the frequency of female, male and gender neutral pronouns in the translated output. We then show that Google Translate exhibits a strong tendency toward male defaults, in particular for fields typically associated to unbalanced gender distribution or stereotypes such as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) jobs. We ran these statistics against BLS’ data for the frequency of female participation in each job position, in which we show that Google Translate fails to reproduce a real-world distribution of female workers. In summary, we provide experimental evidence that even if one does not expect in principle a 50:50 pronominal gender distribution, Google Translate yields male defaults much more frequently than what would be expected from demographic data alone. We believe that our study can shed further light on the phenomenon of machine bias and are hopeful that it will ignite a debate about the need to augment current statistical translation tools with debiasing techniques—which can already be found in the scientific literature.","","Prates MO,Avelar PH,Lamb LC","","2020","6363–6381","10.1007/s00521-019-04144-6","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1007/s00521-019-04144-6;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00521-019-04144-6","Journal Article"
"Automatic Control Method of DDoS Defense Policy through the Monitoring of System Resource","In these day, we obtain various information through internet services and the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks for threatening the services are socially and economically serious threats. Recently, the attacks that occurred in July 2009 significantly damaged to the major internet services of countries such as South Korea. Due to the seriousness of DDoS attacks, these have been researched in a variety of ways in academies and industries to protect the internet services. However, the existing defense methods have the fundamental limitation that can be vulnerable to the unknown DDoS attacks of new traffic pattern to avoid the methods because the methods apply the defense policies of fixed thresholds that are mainly determined by the learning of traffic volume. Thus, whenever the new DDoS attacks are occurred, the damage is also repeated by the attacks. To overcome the problem caused by the fixed threshold, the paper introduces the automatic control method of defense policy against the DDoS attacks through the monitoring of current system resources. We focused on the fact that the usage ratios of various system resources show the abnormal statuses of server if the service failure of server is occurred by that attacks that were not blocked by current defense policies. Our method measures the usage changes of system resources and detects the abnormal situations and automatically adjusts current defense policies in conjunction with the strength of change. As a result, the DDoS attacks are gradually mitigated by the automatic threshold controlling of our method.","","Kim D,Kim B,Kim I,Oh J,Jang J,Cho H","","2011","140–145","","","Conference Paper"
"Automatic Crosslingual Thesaurus Generated from the Hong Kong SAR Police Department Web Corpus for Crime Analysis: Research Articles","For the sake of national security, very large volumes of data and information are generated and gathered daily. Much of this data and information is written in different languages, stored in different locations, and may be seemingly unconnected. Crosslingual semantic interoperability is a major challenge to generate an overview of this disparate data and information so that it can be analyzed, shared, searched, and summarized. The recent terrorist attacks and the tragic events of September 11, 2001 have prompted increased attention on national security and criminal analysis. Many Asian countries and cities, such as Japan, Taiwan, and Singapore, have been advised that they may become the next targets of terrorist attacks. Semantic interoperability has been a focus in digital library research. Traditional information retrieval (IR) approaches normally require a document to share some common keywords with the query. Generating the associations for the related terms between the two term spaces of users and documents is an important issue. The problem can be viewed as the creation of a thesaurus. Apart from this, terrorists and criminals may communicate through letters, e-mails, and faxes in languages other than English. The translation ambiguity significantly exacerbates the retrieval problem. The problem is expanded to crosslingual semantic interoperability. In this paper, we focus on the English/Chinese crosslingual semantic interoperability problem. However, the developed techniques are not limited to English and Chinese languages but can be applied to many other languages. English and Chinese are popular languages in the Asian region. Much information about national security or crime is communicated in these languages. An efficient automatically generated thesaurus between these languages is important to crosslingual information retrieval between English and Chinese languages. To facilitate crosslingual information retrieval, a corpus-based approach uses the term co-occurrence statistics in parallel or comparable corpora to construct a statistical translation model to cross the language boundary. In this paper, the text-based approach to align English/Chinese Hong Kong Police press release documents from the Web is first presented. We also introduce an algorithmic approach to generate a robust knowledge base based on statistical correlation analysis of the semantics (knowledge) embedded in the bilingual press release corpus. The research output consisted of a thesaurus-like, semantic network knowledge base, which can aid in semantics-based crosslingual information management and retrieval. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","","Li KW,Yang CC","","2005","272–282","","","Journal Article"
"Automatic Voltage Controllers for South Korean Power System","The paper proposes two automatic voltage controllers for the South Korean power system. Simulation results from detailed Korean power-flow models show that the controllers can provide significant improvements in security, quality and efficiency of power system voltage monitoring and control. Operating within a time scale ranging from tens of seconds to a few minutes, the controllers can act upon voltage alarms and voltage insecure conditions to maintain prescribed voltage profile and adequate VAR margins. The control actions include continuous adjustment of generator VAR outputs as well as switching of discrete VAR support devices such as shunt capacitor banks. This paper extends an earlier discrete version of the controller developed at Washington State University and tested at Bonneville Power Administration into a hybrid voltage controller. This paper tests the implementation and application of the previously developed discrete as well as the proposed hybrid controllers in Korean power system models.","","","","2009","1–9","10.1109/HICSS.2009.85","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1109/HICSS.2009.85;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/HICSS.2009.85","Conference Paper"
"Beyond Mere Compliance of RFID Regulations by the Farming Community: A Case Study of the Cochrane Dairy Farm","Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is changing the face of livestock identification and management. Beyond satisfying the regulations of government agencies for livestock to be a part of a national identification system for tracking purposes, farmers are now considering venturing beyond mere basic compliance systems. Once installed, farmers have begun to realize that their initial capital investment into an RFID system holds great strategic potential. The initial outlay while substantial is a once only cost that with a few more application-centric uses can yield a return on investment manifold. This paper presents a case study of the Cochrane Dairy Farm situated on the New South Wales South Coast. The case study shows that the Cochrane Dairy farm utilizes advanced total farm management techniques that will before too long lead to greater dividends. The contribution of this paper is in presenting how a dairy farm has adopted RFID initially to meet government directives, and then for broader more personalized requirements. Farming processes are defined explicitly and the paper points to encourage other farmers to consider adoption of RFID beyond the need for compliance and toward the perspective of longer term productivity and strategic visibility.","","Trevarthen A,Michael K","","2007","8","10.1109/ICMB.2007.21","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1109/ICMB.2007.21;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICMB.2007.21","Conference Paper"
"Bilateral Disputes Over Broadband Standards, Interoperability, and WTO Rules: The Need For A Safe Harbor","The development of standards to facilitate the deployment of next generation telecommunications services, particularly for wireless applications, has generated trade policy conflict between the United States and Korea.Specific examples include Korea's development of an interoperable wireless Internet platform for use by mobile operators, as well as a standard for high-speed portable Internet (also known as WiBro in Korea).Do the WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) and the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) constrain member governments from promoting the adoption of air interface protocols and other standards for wireless Internet applications and fourth generation transmission technologies?The answer is yes, but not necessarily to the degree or extent that US companies with an interest in the propagation of proprietary standards have asserted in their various requests for intervention by the US. Trade Representative (USTR) on behalf of their commercial interests.In fact, the GATS and TBT Agreement preserve the sovereign authority of member governments to promote interoperability, consumer welfare, national technological progress, and other public policy goals through the standard-setting process, so long as certain baseline nondiscrimination obligations are respected.Now that Korea and other East Asian economies have achieved leadership positions in the deployment of wireless broadband technology, US industry is no longer in a position to establish de facto standards on the basis of US market trends alone.Concerns in Korea and other non-US. markets (and also among ""open source"" advocates in the United States) about the anti-competitive implications of proprietary standards will therefore have greater weight in shaping future telecommunications standards than in prior years.Rather than seek to interpret the WTO agreements as an impediment to the incorporation of public policy objectives in the standard setting process, the US Trade Representative should work with regulators in Korea and other jurisdictions to develop a consensus on the legitimacy of government involvement in standards development.In particular, an understanding should be reached on the basis of a negative list; i.e., a list of government aims or objectives that are not legitimately the object of a standards-setting effort, such as the preclusion of foreign competition or propagation of a domestic monopoly.All other public policy objectives would be presumed consistent with the WTO agreements (and thus receive ""safe harbor"" protection under WTO rules);Interoperability would fall within the ""safe harbor"" but not if used to deny market access to an entire class of technology rather than a non-interoperable platform within one particular technology class.By presuming a legitimate role for government except with respect to the negative list of impermissible objectives, an international understanding could help to avert future trade disputes. Such an understanding might also encourage the private sector to focus greater effort on interoperability and less on the pursuit of proprietary standards intended to secure monopoly rents.","","Kleinfeld G","","2004","181–187","","","Journal Article"

"Building a Location-Based Set of Social Media Users","In events such as natural disasters, terrorist attacks, or war zones, one can gain critical situational awareness by monitoring what people on the ground are saying in social media. But how does one build a set of users in a specific location from scratch? In “Building a Location-Based Set of Social Media Users,” Christopher Marks and Tauhid Zaman present an algorithm to do just this. The algorithm starts with a small set of seed users in the location and then grows this set using an “expand–classify” approach. They apply the algorithm to diverse regions ranging from South America to the Philippines and in a few hours can collect tens of thousands of Twitter users in the target locations. The algorithm is language agnostic, making it especially useful for anyone trying to gain situational awareness in foreign countries.In many instances, one may want to gain situational awareness in an environment by monitoring the content of local social media users. Often the challenge is how to build a set of users from a target location. Here, we introduce a method for building such a set of users by using an expand–classify approach, which begins with a small set of seed users from the target location and then iteratively collects their neighbors and classifies their locations. We perform this classification using maximum likelihood estimation on a factor graph model that incorporates features of the user profiles and social network connections. We show that maximum likelihood estimation reduces to solving a minimum cut problem on an appropriately defined graph. We are able to obtain several thousand users within a few hours for many diverse locations using our approach. Using geolocated data, we find that our approach typically achieves good accuracy for population centers with fewer than 500,000 inhabitants but is less effective for larger cities. We also find that our approach is able to collect many more users with higher accuracy than existing search methods. Finally, we show that, by studying the content of location-specific users obtained with our approach, we can identify the onset of significant social unrest in locations such as the Philippines.Funding: This work was supported in part by Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, Inc.

"Bypassing the Integrity Checking of Rights Objects in OMA DRM: A Case Study with the MelOn Music Service","Commercial digital music is typically distributed in the music source market via Digital Rights Management systems (DRM). DRM systems help remotely control the music contents. The Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) DRM became the de facto standard after major market adoption because of its support for a wide variety of different business and usage models. In OMA DRM, a popular business model is a (monthly) subscription enforced by controlling the period of playback time; once the given period of time expires, the music cannot be played. In this paper, we demonstrate how to bypass the integrity checking of the rights object in the OMA DRM system through a case study of MelOn (a well-known music distribution service in South Korea) by reverse engineering its media player equipped with a DRM agent.","","Choi J,Aiken W,Ryoo J,Kim H","","2016","","10.1145/2857546.2857609","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/2857546.2857609;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2857546.2857609","Conference Paper"
"CDN Interconnection Service Trial: Implementation and Analysis","Content delivery service has become a major traffic load on today's Internet, and this has triggered the interest of ISPs in operating their own content delivery networks (CDNs) to optimize Internet traffic considering both content delivery caching and user-network proximity. ISPs, however, are typically regionally bound or network-domain-wise isolated; hence, their CDN gain is somewhat limited. In order to enhance the gain of ISP CDN services to the level of incumbent global CDNs, a CDN interconnection (CDNI) model is introduced by IETF, where local ISP CDN services can be extended among heterogeneous CDNs across network domains. However, despite the multiple benefits of a CDNI system, it is difficult to apply a CDNI service to the current CDN market due to the platform independence. Hence, we introduced a CDNI gateway model that is standard-capable and platform-independent. With the CDNI gateway model, we design and implement a complete CDNI system and conduct a CDNI service trial with three major ISPs in South Korea. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first CDNI service trial complying with the IETF standard achieved by a multi-ISP collaboration. According to the analysis of experimental results from the service trial, we observe that CDNI can reduce content traffic by about 40 percent at the Internet exchange link compared to a legacy CDN system.","","Bang Y,Rhee JK,Park K,Lim K,Nam G,Shinn JD,Lee J,Jo S,Koo JR,Sung J,Seo YI,Choi T,Kim HI,Park J,Yun CH","","2016","94–100","10.1109/MCOM.2016.7498094","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1109/MCOM.2016.7498094;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2016.7498094","Journal Article"

"Challenges in Secure Sensor-Cloud Computing","Cloud computing is a concept that has received significant attention lately. With advances in virtualization, coupled with the demand for services, many initiatives are underway in the environment of cloud computing. At this point, most of the services in cloud Computing are broadly in the paradigm of computing and storage, and in the traditional Client Server mode. With the recent explosion of wireless sensor networks and their applicability in civilian and military applications, there is an emerging vision for integrating sensor networks into the cloud. Practical systems like Microsoft's SensorMap and Asia Pacific Environmental Sensor Grid are attestations to the enormous potential for sensor networks to be integrated into the cloud. In this framework users need not own sensor networks. Sensor Network owners after a mission need not disband the networks. There is a symbiotic relationship wherein sensor network owners can provide a variety of services to customers for profit. Customers also benefit from a variety of remote services without being physically close to the environment of interest. However, despite the benefits of sensor-clouds, security issues are largely open. A variety of new threats and attacks are possible, and existing solutions in standalone sensor networks will not be applicable in the cloud. The vision of this article is to introduce the sensor-cloud computing and overview the research challenges from the security perspective.","","Poolsappasit N,Kumar V,Madria S,Chellappan S","","2011","70–84","","","Conference Paper"

"Characterizing Security and Privacy Practices in Emerging Digital Credit Applications","Access to credit can provide capital crucial to both businesses and individuals. Unfortunately, for large parts of the developing world, access to credit is not available because customers often lack the traditional data used by lenders to make such decisions (e.g., verifiable payroll statements, property ownership documents). Emerging online credit services address this need through the use of non-traditional creditworthiness data, which many believe to include user geolocation and social network information. While such systems both potentially expand credit availability and improve usability through instant evaluation, their security and privacy practices remain opaque. In this paper, we perform the first comprehensive security analysis of the emerging online credit space. To provide improved transparency, we select 51 representative companies across the industry, analyze their privacy policies and compare them to the sensitive data types mobile applications actually gather. We then evaluate the configuration of connections between mobile apps and their supporting servers to determine whether they securely handle such data. Our analysis demonstrates significant security and privacy issues across this burgeoning industry, including the gathering of previously undisclosed data types and widespread mis-configuration of encryption. We conclude by discussing our efforts to work with partners in and around the industry to improve these issues.","Yes","Bowers J,Sherman IN,Butler KR,Traynor P","","2019","94–107","10.1145/3317549.3319723","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3317549.3319723;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3317549.3319723","Conference Paper"

"Collaboration Tool for Distributed Open Source Verification","Samsung R&D Institute Brazil (SRBR) is one of Samsung's research centers around the world. SRBR work is focused on research on software development areas. SRBR software development teams have worked in collaboration with Samsung headquarters (HQ), located at South Korea, and Brazilian outsourcing companies (SIDI Institute and other Brazilian partners). Considering the massive volume of software developed by SRBR and partners teams, there naturally has been an enormous use and contribution of open source software. The usage of open source software (OSS) by Samsung and its research centers follows a process to ensure that all use is compliant with OSS licenses. This experience report describes OSKB (Open Source Knowledge Base) tool, a distributed collaboration Web application fully integrated with a tracking issue system, currently used by SRBR teams involved with software development for avoiding duplicated work and improving knowledge sharing among SRBR internal and partners teams. The main reasons behind OSKB development were automating the first step of OSS licenses verification activity reducing duplicated work, serving as a knowledge base of OSS analysis, reducing the time spent in back office operations related with OSS usage and mitigating OSS usage compliance risks.","","Filho RN,de Souza Pereira M,Faria CS,Lemos GS","","2019","129–132","10.1109/ICGSE.2019.00034","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1109/ICGSE.2019.00034;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICGSE.2019.00034","Conference Paper"
"Communication as Information-Seeking: The Case for Mobile Social Software for Developing Regions","In this paper, we describe several findings from a multi-year, multi-method study of how information and communication technologies have been adopted and adapted in Central Asia. We have found that mobile phone usage is outpacing the rate of Internet adoption, that access to the Internet is primarily through public access sites carrying with it issues regarding privacy and surveillance, that people rely on their social networks as information sources, that public institutions tend to be fairly weak as citizen resources, and that information seeking and communication are conflated in people's usage patterns with different technologies. In addition, in the developed world social networking software has grown rapidly and shown itself to have significant potential for mobilizing a population. Based on the collection of findings from Central Asia and observing patterns of technology usage in other parts of the world, our research leads to the conclusion that exploring mobile social software holds significant potential as an ICT that meshes well with preexisting patterns of communication and information seeking and also leverages the most predominant pattern of technology adoption. Many of the findings from this research echo results from studies in other geographic areas, and so we anticipate that much of this research will be relevant to developing regions generally.","","Kolko BE,Rose EJ,Johnson EJ","","2007","863–872","10.1145/1242572.1242689","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/1242572.1242689;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1242572.1242689","Conference Paper"
"Compatible 2D-Code Having Tamper Detection System with QR-Code","The matrix barcodes known as Quick Response (QR) codes, which are enable us to import printed digital information into smart-phone or cell phone through its digital camera easily, are rapidly becoming widespread not only Japan but also Asia, Europe and America. However, an attacker is easily able to lead malicious web-sites by putting a unauthenticated QR code on a authenticated QR code. We propose a compatible 2d-code having tamper detection system with QR-code. In digital signature system, a hash value of a message is calculated firstly, and then the hash value is encrypted by a secret key which is a pair of public key cryptography system. Then, a sender sends the message and the encrypted hash value to a receiver. In the receiver side, the hash value of a sent message is calculated and the hash value with encrypted is decrypted using a public key which is a pair of public key cryptography system. The receiver can detect modification of the message by comparing the two hash values. The encrypted hash value is embedded by using Wet Paper code within cells of QR-codes. In this paper, we report the robustness of reading cells of QR code which plays an important role in our code and the state of the progress for the implementation of the proposed system.","","Ishihara T,Niimi M","","2014","493–496","10.1109/IIH-MSP.2014.129","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1109/IIH-MSP.2014.129;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IIH-MSP.2014.129","Conference Paper"
"Computer-Aided Optimization of DNA Array Design and Manufacturing","DNA probe arrays, or DNA chips, have emerged as a core genomic technology that enables cost-effective gene expression monitoring, mutation detection, single nucleotide polymorphism analysis, and other genomic analyses. DNA chips are manufactured through a highly scalable process called very large-scale immobilized polymer synthesis (VLSIPS) that combines photolithographic technologies adapted from the semiconductor industry with combinatorial chemistry. Commercially available DNA chips contain more than half a million probes and are expected to exceed 100 million probes in the next generation. This paper is one of the first attempts to apply very large scale integration (VLSI) computer-aided design methods to the physical design of DNA chips, where the main objective is to minimize total border cost (i.e., the number of nucleotide mismatches between adjacent sites). By exploiting analogies between manufacturing processes for DNA arrays and for VLSI chips, the authors demonstrate the potential for transfer of methodologies from the 40-year-old field of electronic design automation to the newer DNA array design field. The main contributions of this paper are the following. First, it proposes several partitioning-based algorithms for DNA probe placement that improve solution quality by over 4% compared to best previously known methods. Second, it gives a new design flow for DNA arrays, which enhances current methodologies by adding flow awareness to each optimization step and introducing feedback loops. Third, it proposes solution methods for new formulations integrating multiple design steps, including probe selection, placement, and embedding. Finally, it introduces new techniques to experimentally evaluate the scalability and suboptimality of existing and newly proposed probe placement algorithms. Interestingly, the authors find that DNA placement algorithms appear to have better suboptimality properties than those recently reported for VLSI placement algorithms [C.- C.

"Conceptualizing a Model for Adoption of Cloud Computing in Education","We developed a model for cloud computing adopting in education.Triangulation of two popular adoption theories used as theoretical basis.We contextualized the adoption process for developing countries.Socio-cultural factors were found to be crucial for sub-Saharan Africa.Results demonstrability not supported as critical factor for adoption model. Cloud computing is a pervasive computing paradigm that has revolutionized how computer infrastructure and services are delivered. Current research trends on cloud computing have been focused on the technology, applications, costs, benefits, and security of cloud computing at the organizational level within small and medium sized enterprises. Little research attention has been paid on adoption and usage of cloud computing at educational establishments and how contextual factors can influence diffusion and adoption of cloud computing. Universities in developing countries are faced with challenging socio-economic and political constraints that limit their ability to invest in expensive information systems to compete on the global stage. Using constructs from the diffusion of innovation theory and the technology acceptance model, this paper proposes a model that takes account of contextual, economic, and technological influences in the perception and adoption of cloud computing at universities in sub-Saharan Africa. Results from a pilot study, based on the model, through a survey of university lecturers and IS experts shows reliability and validity of the instrument and supports its usage for a more extensive study. Implications, potential contributions to research, and suggestions for future study are discussed.","","Sabi HM,Uzoka FM,Langmia K,Njeh FN","","2016","183–191","10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2015.11.010","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2015.11.010;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2015.11.010","Journal Article"

"Contextualizing Learning in the World Wide Web: Accounting for the Impact of Culture","There is a developing urgency about how Australian universities should best make use of the World Wide Web (WWW) to meet the needs of culturally diverse students, especially those of Asian origin. This urgency is the result of both global and internal pressures, some political, (consider the imminence of the ‘Hanson movement‘ against a multicultural Australia), some economic, some social. Moreover, to miss the current opportunity to exploit WWW technologies to design, implement and market effective instructional courses will only work to disadvantage Australia in a growing but globally competitive educational market. One of the most pressing problems in this context is how to provide instructional materials in a model of teaching and learning that is cost-effective, makes extensive use of WWW technologies to provide for flexibility in learning, and that is culturally appropriate. This paper outlines an approach and model for investigating and developing culturally appropriate instructional materials. It is hoped that through publication, we might obtain feedback on the validity of this model and also widen the potential of its scope beyond its immediate application to the Australian context. The following hypotheses are central to our work: (1) Existing cultural influences in instructional materials designed and delivered on the WWW by Australian universities, and intended for use by culturally diverse students, are minimal and ineffective. (2) The efficacy of learning based in the use of the WWW for instructional purposes can be improved by the adoption of a culturally appropriate model of instructional design. (3) Culture is a significant factor in determining the effectiveness of learning materials created in the WWW and intended for use by culturally diverse students. In testing these hypotheses, we intend to provide the empirical research to help determine the most appropriate ways of using the WWW to stimulate effective learning at tertiary level for all learners, whatever their cultural heritage or perspectives","","Wild M,Henderson L","","1998","179–192","10.1023/A:1018661213335","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1023/A:1018661213335;http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1018661213335","Journal Article"
"Cooperative Use of Unmanned Sea Surface and Micro Aerial Vehicles at Hurricane Wilma","On Oct. 24, 2005, Hurricane Wilma, a category 5 storm, made landfall at Cape Romano, Florida. Three days later, the Center for Robot-Assisted Search and Rescue at the University of South Florida deployed an iSENYS helicopter and a prototype unmanned water surface vehicle, AEOS-1, to survey damage in parts of Marco Island, 14 km from landfall. The effort was the first known use of unmanned sea surface vehicles (USVs) for emergency response and established their suitability for the recovery phase of disaster management by detecting damage to seawalls and piers, locating submerged debris (moorings and handrails), and determining safe lanes for sea navigation. It provides a preliminary domain theory of postdisaster port and littoral inspection with unmanned vehicles for use by the human–robot interaction community. It was also the first known demonstration of the strongly heterogeneous USV–micro aerial vehicle (MAV) team for any domain. The effort identified cooperative UAV–USV strategies and open issues for autonomous operations near structures. The effort showed that the MAV provided a much-needed external view for situation awareness and provided spotting for areas to be inspected. Concepts of operations for USV damage inspection and USV–MAV cooperation emerged, including a formula for computing the human–robot ratio: Nh = (2 × Nv) + 1, where Nh is the number of humans and Nv is the number of vehicles. The outstanding research issues span three areas: challenges for USVs operating near littoral structures, general issues for USV–MAV cooperation, and new applications. It is expected that the lessons learned will be transferrable to defense and homeland safety and security applications, such as port security, and other phases of emergency response, including rescue. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","","Murphy RR,Steimle E,Griffin C,Cullins C,Hall M,Pratt K","","2008","164–180","","","Journal Article"

"Counting to Be Counted: Anganwadi Workers and Digital Infrastructures of Ambivalent Care","Data collection on the population is a key mode of public health management in the Global South. This information is seen as a means to improve health metrics through welfare programs. In this study, we examine the changes brought about by an ICT-based Real-Time Monitoring System to the infrastructure of a welfare program and the nature of work of Anganwadi workers in India. Anganwadi workers, traditionally serving as daycare providers and community health workers, are increasingly being asked to serve primarily as data collectors for the new digital system. We ask the question 'cui bono?' to this system by drawing attention to the precarity of Anganwadi workers whose care-work is standardized through this app for 'efficient' monitoring by the Indian state but remains contingent on their relationship with the local community and ability to mobilize resources on the ground. Using auto-ethnographic and interview methods, we find that Anganwadi workers are caught between conflicting demands of state bureaucracy and the situated nature of their care work resulting in forms of ambivalent care. We find that the real-time monitoring apps intended to collect data for efficient delivery of state services end up serving the state's need for performing care through data rhetorics produced at the expense of the professional and personal well-being of the workers, and arguably the communities they serve.","","S P AM,Vaghela P,Pal J","","2022","","10.1145/3555177","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3555177;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3555177","Journal Article"
"Coupled Behavior Analysis for Capturing Coupling Relationships in Group-Based Market Manipulations","In stock markets, an emerging challenge for surveillance is that a group of hidden manipulators collaborate with each other to manipulate the price movement of securities. Recently, the coupled hidden Markov model (CHMM)-based coupled behavior analysis (CBA) has been proposed to consider the coupling relationships in the above group-based behaviors for manipulation detection. From the modeling perspective, however, this requires overall aggregation of the behavioral data to cater for the CHMM modeling, which does not differentiate the coupling relationships presented in different forms within the aggregated behaviors and degrade the capability for further anomaly detection. Thus, this paper suggests a general CBA framework for detecting group-based market manipulation by capturing more comprehensive couplings and proposes two variant implementations, which are hybrid coupling (HC)-based and hierarchical grouping (HG)-based respectively. The proposed framework consists of three stages. The first stage, qualitative analysis, generates possible qualitative coupling relationships between behaviors with or without domain knowledge. In the second stage, quantitative representation of coupled behaviors is learned via proper methods. For the third stage, anomaly detection algorithms are proposed to cater for different application scenarios. Experimental results on data from a major Asian stock market show that the proposed framework outperforms the CHMM-based analysis in terms of detecting abnormal collaborative market manipulations. Additionally, the two different implementations are compared with their effectiveness for different application scenarios.","","Song Y,Cao L,Wu X,Wei G,Ye W,Ding W","","2012","976–984","10.1145/2339530.2339683","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/2339530.2339683;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2339530.2339683","Conference Paper"

"Culture-Bound Technological Solutions: An Artificial-Theoretic Insight","Sometimes, technological solutions to practical problems are devised that conspicuously take into account the constraints to which a given culture is subjecting the particular task or the manner in which it is carried out. The culture may be a professional culture (e.g., the practice of law), or an ethnic-cum-professional culture (e.g., dance in given ethnic cultures from South-East Asia), or, again, a denominational culture prescribing an orthopraxy impinging on everyday life through, for example, prescribed abstinence from given categories of workday activities, or dietary laws.Massimo Negrotti'sTheory of the artificial is a convenient framework for discussing some of these techniques. We discuss a few examples, but focus on the contrast of two that are taken from the same cultural background, namely, technological applications in compliance with Jewish Law orthopraxy.. Soya-, mycoprotein- or otherwise derived meat surrogates are an example ofnaturoid; they emulate the flavours and olfactory properties, as well as the texture and the outer and inner appearance, of the meat product (its kind, cut, form) they set out to emulate (including amenability to cooking in the usual manner for the model), while satisfying cultural dietary prohibitions.. In contrast, the Sabbath Notebook, a writing surrogate we describe in this paper, is atechnoid: it emulates a technique (writing to store alphanumeric information), while satisfying the prohibition of writing at particular times of the liturgical calendar (the Sabbath and the major holidays).","","Nissan E","","2000","411–439","","","Journal Article"
"D-InSAR Monitoring of Crustal Deformation in the Eastern Segment of the Altyn Tagh Fault","In recent years, the differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (D-InSAR) technique has been widely used in monitoring deformation on the Earth's surface. Compared with conventional approaches (such as global positioning system (GPS) monitoring), application of the D-InSAR technique has many advantages in surface deformation monitoring. In this paper, the D-InSAR technique is applied to study the crustal deformation characteristics of the eastern segment of the Altyn Tagh Fault (ATF), which is an important boundary of crustal deformation in the north-eastern area of the Tibetan Plateau. To the north of the boundary, the deformation gradually decreases from 2.8 cm in the west to 0.8 cm in the east; to the south of the boundary, the deformation presents different characteristics at the two sides of the western part of the North Qilian Shan Fault (NQF). At the south-west side, the deformation is intense, with relatively weaker deformation of 1.6∼2.1 cm inside the Changma Basin and stronger deformation of 2.2∼6.0 cm outside the Changma Basin. At the north-east side, the deformation is smaller than that in the other side, with a decrease from 1.3 cm in the west to nearly 0 cm in the east. North-east to the western part of the NQF, there exists negative deformation. This is because when the northern margin of the Tibetan Plateau was moving to the north-east, it was blocked off by the rigid Alashan Block and was bent down close to the north-east of the Qilian Shan Orogen to form a foreland basin. This paper also shows that currently the ATF is active and has left-lateral strike-slip. The slip rate of the eastern segment of the ATF is 4.7 mm/year. For different locations, the slip rate is different.","","Ding X,Huang W","","2011","1797–1806","10.1080/01431160903490190","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1080/01431160903490190;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431160903490190","Journal Article"
"Data Mining Cancer Registries: Retrospective Surveillance of Small Area Time Trends in Cancer Incidence Using BaySTDetect","Space-time modelling of small area data is often used in epidemiology for mapping temporal trends in chronic disease rates. For rare diseases such as cancers, data are sparse, and a Bayesian hierarchical modelling approach is typically adopted in order to smooth the raw disease rates. Although there may be a general temporal trend which affect all areas similarly, abrupt changes may also occur in particular areas due to, for example, emergence of localized risk factor(s) or impact of a new health or screening policy. Detection of areas with ``unusual'' temporal patterns is therefore important to flag-up areas warranting further investigations. In this paper, we present a novel area of application of a recently proposed detection method, Bays Detect, for short time series of small area data. Placed within the Bayesian model choice framework, Bays Detect detects unusual time trends based on comparison of two competing space-time models. The first model is a straightforward multiplicative decomposition of the area effect and the temporal effect, assuming one single temporal pattern across the whole study region. The second model estimates a local time trend, independently for each area. An area-specific model indicator is introduced to select which model offers a better description of the local data. Classification of an area local time trend as ``unusual'' or not is based on the posterior mean of this model indicator, which represents the probability that the common trend model is appropriate for that area. An important feature of the method is that the classification rule can be fine-tuned to control the false detection rate (FDR). Based on previous simulation results, we present some further insights of the model specification in relation to the detection performance in practice. Bays Detect is then applied to data on several different cancers collected by the Thames Cancer Registry in South East England to illustrate its potential in retrospective surveillance.","","Li G,Richardson S,Fortunato L,Ahmed I,Hansell A,Toledano M,Best N","","2011","885–890","10.1109/ICDMW.2011.59","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1109/ICDMW.2011.59;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICDMW.2011.59","Conference Paper"
"Design and Deployment of Federation Testbed in EU-KR for Identifier-Based Communications","SmartFIRE is the first intercontinental testbed, federating multiple small-scale testbeds in South Korea and Europe, which exploits the benefits and building blocks of an OpenFlow-based infrastructure. As a part of SmartFIRE, both ETRI and UMU designs and develops a federation testbed for Identifier-based communications that all of communication services are achieved by Identifier not by IP address. In order to manage and control the testbed, we deploy a Measurement and Management Framework (OMF), further we will deploy SFA aggregate manager to federate with other SmartFIRE testbed. In this paper we introduce the federation testbed for ID-based communications including network connectivity, architecture configuration, and federation architecture. Moreover, to exploit the testbed, we design and implement two mobility use cases that we show seamless network connection service under host's mobility, such as intra-domain handover and inter-domain handover. Thus we can show result of the experimentation that the communication session wouldn't be cut off even though communication entity moves to a different network. Finally we refer future works for federation to cooperate with other SmartFIRE testbeds and additional ID-based communication scenario.","","You T,Martinez-Julia P,Skarmeta A,Jung H","","2015","13–16","10.1145/2775088.2775100","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/2775088.2775100;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2775088.2775100","Conference Paper"
"Design of Six-Wheeled Planetary Rover with a Novel Hybrid Suspension","A novel hybrid suspension of six-wheeled planetary rover based on serial multi-articulated suspension is proposed. The differential balance support mechanism that is important component of the hybrid suspension and solves the problem of weak carrying capacity of serial suspension, is synthesized by using the constraint synthesis method based on screw theory and mechanism combination method. Taking the envelope volume and the maximum height of obstacles that can be overcome of the hybrid suspension rover as objective functions, the geometric parameters of the hybrid suspension structure are optimized through the elitist nondominated sorting genetic algorithm. The proposed hybrid suspension not only can conform passively to very rugged terrain, but also provides active mobility to cross obstacles and ditches, as well as passes soft terrain and steep slopes in wheel-legged locomotion. The established 3D and simulation models are used to simulate and verily the mobile performance of the hybrid suspension rover. The novel hybrid suspension has important reference significance for the design of the future lunar south pole rover.","","Hu S,Wang G,Tao J","","2022","386–391","10.1109/ROBIO54168.2021.9739375","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1109/ROBIO54168.2021.9739375;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ROBIO54168.2021.9739375","Conference Paper"
"Detection and Spatial Analysis of Selective Logging with Geometrically Corrected Landsat Images","The Brazilian Amazonian rain forests are under imminent threat of serious degradation and ultimately deforestation. Human activities such as selective logging are an important cause. Selectively logged locations are difficult to detect from medium-resolution Landsat images, due to their relatively small sizes and subtle spatial patterns. Spectral linear unmixing provides an effective tool for the purpose. The orientation of geometrically corrected images, however, artificially introduces zero-reflectance background pixels. These change the variance–covariance structure of the image bands and hinder the identification of pure endmembers. In this study, we compare image cropping and image rotation as two alternative approaches. Selectively logged forests were detected in northern Rondônia state, north-western Mato Grosso state and south-eastern Amazonas state in Brazil by applying spectral unmixing. The study shows that image rotation is a better approach as it preserves the image extent and thus provides information on forest degradation over a wider region. Spatial statistical analysis of the detected locations shows strong clustering within the study area. We conclude that the endmembers used in this study represent basic components of a degraded forest environment. As spectral unmixing of remote-sensing images avoids collection of field data, it may broadly be applied towards other Amazonian regions as well.","","Anwar S,Stein A","","2012","7820–7843","10.1080/01431161.2012.701378","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1080/01431161.2012.701378;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2012.701378","Journal Article"

"Disclosure-Free GPS Trace Search in Smartphone Networks","In this paper we present a powerful distributed framework for finding similar trajectories in a smart phone network, without disclosing the traces of participating users. Our framework, coined Smart Trace, exploits opportunistic and participatory sensing in order to quickly answer queries of the form: ""Report the users that move more similar to Q, where Q is some query trace"". Smart Trace, relies on an in-situ data storage model, where geo-location data is recorded locally on smart phones for both performance and data-disclosure reasons. Smart Trace then deploys an efficient top-K query processing algorithm that exploits distributed trajectory similarity measures, resilient to spatial and temporal noise, in order to derive the most relevant answers to Q quickly and efficiently. We assess our ideas with realistic and real workloads from Microsoft Research Asia and other sources. Our study reveals that Smart Trace computes the desired results with 74% less energy consumption and 13% faster than its centralized and decentralized counterparts. Our experimental results also confirm our analytical study.","","Zeinalipour-Yazti D,Laoudias C,Andreou MI,Gunopulos D","","2011","78–87","10.1109/MDM.2011.11","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1109/MDM.2011.11;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MDM.2011.11","Conference Paper"
"Distinguishing the Windthrow and Hydrogeological Effects of Typhoon Impact on Agricultural Lands: An Integrative OBIA and PPGIS Approach","The agricultural impacts of tropical cyclones remain the primary threat to livelihoods in Southeast Asia and Latin America. The impacts take two forms, one is windthrow, i.e. uprooted or snapped trees, caused by strong wind, and the other is hydrogeological effects from heavy precipitation. The empirical effects are different for the two forms. However, little previous research has been devoted to distinguishing the two effects to estimate agricultural losses, and even fewer have used moderate-resolution 10 m resolution images. This study presents a methodological progression to address this deficiency. First, an object-based image analytical method distinguishes the two effects using Satellite Pour l’Observation de la Terre – 5 satellite images. Various object-based features are compared to acquire their spectral, textural, and geometric characteristics for the interpretation. Second, a public participation geographical information system PPGIS approach is developed that combines community empowerment and collaborative field survey to rebuild and represent ground truth during disasters for image validation. The method is applied to a case study of typhoon Bopha that struck Compostela Valley, eastern Mindanao, the Philippines in December 2012. Our assessment indicates that the producer accuracy reaches 88.9% for debris and mud flows and 83.3% for windthrow, and user accuracy reaches 94% and 81%, respectively. The result indicates that the proposed methods have great potential for distinguishing the two effects. It also highlights the efficacy of integrating PPGIS with remote sensing, for image validation purposes and in practice to enhance local residents’ environmental consciousness for enhancing adaptive capacity in resource limited regions.","","Chen TH,Lin KH","","2018","131–148","10.1080/01431161.2017.1382741","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1080/01431161.2017.1382741;http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01431161.2017.1382741","Journal Article"
"Economic and Operational Impact Analysis of a Mobile Automated Fingerprint Identification System (MAFIS) for the Philippine National Police","The Philippines, an archipelago consisting of 7,640 islands, is located in Southeast Asia. The Philippine National Police (PNP) is the civilian national police force of the country. Currently, there are 1,766 Police Stations established nationwide. The PNP comprises 90 Component City Police stations and 1,507 Municipal Police stations under the Police Provincial Offices. There are 131 Police Stations under the City Police Offices and 38 City Police Stations in the National Capital Regional Police Office, which serves as the primary operating arms of the PNP for the anti-criminality campaign. The PNP faces challenges on criminal identification processes turnaround time. All fingerprints recovered from the crime scenes needed to be forwarded to the national headquarter for identification and resolution. The development of the Mobile Automated Fingerprint Identification System (MAFIS) can address such challenges. The researchers used this occasion to conduct a feasibility assessment on the proposed Mobile Automated Fingerprint Identification System's economic and operational aspects. The economic feasibility study results revealed that the MAFIS, in conjunction with the mobile automated fingerprint identification system, has a good chance of becoming a long-term way of addressing fingerprint identification in the country. After five years, the system has a 43.1 percent ROI (return on investment), a 22.2 percent IRR (internal rate of return), and payback after year 5. Based on the speed and performance tests results, MAFIS has achieved a performance speed of 0.8s faster than the optimal value of 2.5s, according to PageSpeed Insights. MAFIS has a measured value of 10ms quicker than 100ms, according to the PSI test findings. The reliability and availability results reveal that the created system was highly acceptable, with an overall mean of 4.61 and a standard deviation of 0.78, indicating that most responses were near the average. MAFIS was rated as efficient and highly acceptable in the evaluation, with an overall mean of 4.85. The test also revealed that MAFIS' overall usability is outstanding, with a weighted mean of 1.47. The capacity and scalability have a weighted mean of 4.90, with a deviation of 0.30, which means highly acceptable. The maintainability evaluation findings also showed that MAFIS is very satisfactory, with an overall mean of 4.82. The system's security test revealed that MAFIS passed the TLS and SSL with a B grade from Qualys SSL Labs. It also received an A+ overall degree based on CryptCheck's rating standards. The MAFIS has proven to be both fiscally and operationally viable.","","Penaflor Rey W,V.

"Effects of Ego Involvement and Social Norms on Individuals' Uploading Intention on Wikipedia: A Comparative Study between the United States and South Korea","This study investigates the reasons and factors associated with individuals' intentions to upload content on Wikipedia with a focus on the role of ego involvement and social norms. The study also compares the associations between the factors and uploading intentions of two different cultures, the United States and South Korea. Using data from surveys of college students from the two countries n=249 and 173, structural equation modeling analyses revealed that ego involvement not only plays an essential role in explaining uploading intention but also functions as an antecedent of attitude and perceived behavioral control in both countries. However, the subjective norm was not significantly associated with uploading intention in either country, and the descriptive norm was a marginally significant factor in accounting for uploading intention in the United States. Moreover, it was found that, only in the United States, attitude was significantly associated with uploading intention, whereas perceived behavioral control was a significant factor in explaining uploading intention in both countries. These findings suggest that the effects of cultural differences, the impact of subjective norms in particular, may be weakened with the more self-oriented nature of Web 2.0 applications and social media such as Wikipedia. Theoretical implications are discussed.","","Park N,Oh HS,Kang N","","2015","1494–1506","10.1002/asi.23262","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1002/asi.23262;http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/asi.23262","Journal Article"

"Evolutionary Attribute Ordering in Bayesian Networks for Predicting the Metabolic Syndrome","The metabolic syndrome is a set of risk factors that include abdominal obesity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia and hypertension. It has affected around 25% of adults in the US and become a serious problem in Asian countries recently due to the change in dietary habit and life style. On the other hand, Bayesian networks that are the models to solve the problems of uncertainty provide a robust and transparent formalism for probabilistic modeling, so they have been used as a method for diagnostic or prognostic model in medical domain. Since the K2 algorithm, a well-known algorithm for Bayesian networks structure learning, is influenced by an input order of the attributes, an optimization of BN attribute ordering has been studied as a research issue. This paper proposes a novel ordering optimization method using a genetic algorithm based on medical expert knowledge in order to solve this problem. For experiments, we use the dataset examined twice in 1993 and 1995 in Yonchon County of Korea. It has 18 attributes of 1193 subjects participated in both surveys. Using this dataset, we make the prognostic model of the metabolic syndrome using Bayesian networks with an optimized ordering by evolutionary approach. Through an ordering optimization, the prognostic model of higher performance is constructed, and the optimized Bayesian network model by the proposed method outperforms the conventional BN model as well as neural networks and k-nearest neighbors. Finally, we present the application program using the prognostic model of the metabolic syndrome in order to show the usefulness of the proposed method.","","Park HS,Cho SB","","2012","4240–4249","10.1016/j.eswa.2011.09.110","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1016/j.eswa.2011.09.110;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2011.09.110","Journal Article"

"Experience from Hosting a Corporate Prediction Market: Benefits beyond the Forecasts","Prediction markets are virtual stock markets used to gain insight and forecast events by leveraging the wisdom of crowds. Popularly applied in the public to cultural questions (election results, box-office returns), they have recently been applied by corporations to leverage employee knowledge and forecast answers to business questions (sales volumes, products and features, release timing). Determining whether to run a prediction market requires practical experience that is rarely described. Over the last few years, Ford Motor Company obtained practical experience by deploying one of the largest corporate prediction markets known. Business partners in the US, Europe, and South America provided questions on new vehicle features, sales volumes, take rates, pricing, and macroeconomic trends.We describe our experience, including both the strong and weak correlations found between predictions and real world results. Evaluating this methodology goes beyond prediction accuracy, however, since there are many side benefits. In addition to the predictions, we discuss the value of comments, stock price changes over time, the ability to overcome bureaucratic limits, and flexibly filling holes in corporate knowledge, enabling better decision making. We conclude with advice on running prediction markets, including writing good questions, market duration, motivating traders and protecting confidential information.","","Montgomery TA,Stieg PM,Cavaretta MJ,Moraal PE","","2013","1384–1392","10.1145/2487575.2488212","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/2487575.2488212;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2487575.2488212","Conference Paper"
"Exploring Risk and Benefit Factors Affecting User Adoption Intention of Fintech in Indonesia","The presence of Fintech as an innovative and disruptive financial service can improve the efficiency and scope of financial services through the application of technology. Fintech is considered to have various benefits. However, based on survey conducted by DailySocial and Otoritas Jasa Keuangan finds that the Fintech adoption rate in Indonesia is still relatively low at around 58.1%, this is in line with a penetration level of Fintech in Asia which Indonesia usage level still in 5% compared to China, Hong Kong, and India. In determining Fintech adoption, users tend to do rational calculations by comparing the perceived benefits and risks and will decide to adopt them when the perceived benefits are greater than the risks received. According to some studies, trust can be mediated to reduce some level of risk, thus this study will also include trust variables in the risk-benefit framework to determine user adoption intention on Fintech services in Indonesia. Based on data collected from 100 Fintech users, this study initially investigated whether perceived benefits and risks significantly impacted Fintech adoption intention. Partial Least Square (PLS-SEM) method is used to estimate the relationship between constructs. As a resulting trust, economic benefit and convenience are proven to significantly influence the user to adopt Fintech. While privacy awareness, financial risk, and legal risk are significantly affected by user trust. The hypothesis testing indicates that security risk has the biggest negative effect and convenience has the biggest positive effect on Fintech adoption intention.","Yes","Haqqi FR,Suzianti A","","2020","13–18","10.1145/3400934.3400939","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3400934.3400939;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3400934.3400939","Conference Paper"

"Firefly-Inspired and Robust Time Synchronization for Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks","Harnessing the full power of the paradigm-shifting cognitive radio ad hoc networks (CRAHNs) hinges on solving the problem of time synchronization between the radios on the different stages of the cognitive radio cycle. The dynamic network topology, the temporal and spatial variations in spectrum availability, and the distributed multi-hop architecture of CRAHNs mandate novel solutions to achieve time synchronization and efficiently support spectrum sensing, access, decision and mobility. In this article, we advance this research agenda by proposing the novel Bio-inspired time SynChronization protocol for CRAHNs (BSynC). The protocol draws on the spontaneous firefly synchronization observed in parts of Southeast Asia. The significance of BSynC lies in its capability of promoting symmetric time synchronization between pairs of network nodes independent of the network topology or a predefined sequence for synchronization. It enables the nodes in CRAHNs to efficiently synchronize in a decentralized manner, and it is also reliable to changes, faults and attacks. The findings suggest that BSynC improves convergence time, thereby favoring deployment in dynamic network scenarios.","","Lipa N,Mannes E,Santos A,Nogueira M","","2015","36–44","10.1016/j.comcom.2015.04.005","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1016/j.comcom.2015.04.005;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.comcom.2015.04.005","Journal Article"
"Game Based Technology to Enhance the Learning of History and Cultural Heritage","New Game technologies can support the learning process of user within a Cultural Heritage site. The level of realism is ideal to visualize cultural heritage if a strong focus on the environment's atmosphere and immersion is required. Moreover this is not achievable through ""static"" 3D rendering.The use of the most appropriate navigation metaphors, according to the different categories of users, can help them highlight and ease their understanding. Similarly navigation metaphors can amplify the role played by the discovery process, which is extremely important in the context of learning. Additionally video games are the perfect means to bring cultural heritage closer to children, pupils, who are traditionally familiar with the concept to walking and navigating into virtual worlds.This work will present an application, using game engine technology, whereby the virtual environment and its interactions are used to promote the learning history. The work presented is the result of NETConnect, a 36 month project funded by the EC through the Culture2000 Programme. The seven partners of the consortium have worked together, sharing interdisciplinary competences and different cultural experiences, with the following goals:• To gather common cultural heritage of European significance.• To use state-of-the-art technology to make European heritage more visible and to improve accessibility to European heritage with major benefits for the general public.• To improve participation in cultural activities through new technologies.• To promote cooperation between cultural operators and technology experts, leading to an International Network on new Technologies in Europe for Cultural Heritage.The project encompasses three archeological sites that share common cultural traits, specifically: Lokroi (Magna Graecia, today South of Italy), Glauberg (Germany), Biskupin (Poland).The virtual environment developed has been designed to be used by non expert and suitable for use by a wide and heterogeneous public such as families, elderly people, students. The 3D reconstructions followed a graphics style similar to visual language adopted by video games, emphasising environmental effects such as fog, sky, water, particles. When interacting with the environment the user perceives it as if they were playing a video game. The challenge of finding relevant pieces of information organized through a set of hotspots became the means to learn the history of the site. These relevant Points Of Interest (POI) contain additional multimedia material (e.g. video, images, 3D model, text) becomes accessible to the user.Moreover we have paid specific attention to the creation of a user-friendly and universal (i.e. suitable for all type of users) interface which can be used during the visit at the museum premises. Since it was requested to make a VR application as immersive and interactive as possible we have decided to introduce the feature to handle new navigation metaphors. Indeed, through scripting, it become possible to configure and use the new Nintendo controller. This functionality, allowing the user to move in the virtual world using the Nunchuck, to look around his/her position using the Wiimote and to interact with the virtual scene using these two controllers.The game engine chosen for the project is Unity3D (www.unity3d.com) which allows the creation of both web-based (through a free plug-in) and standalone interactive environments which can be available at the premises of a museum or archeological site. This choice was made for several reasons: first, it features a simple authoring interface to create and edit the 3D scene with the possibility to enjoy real time lights and shadows. Secondly it exploits the latest graphical hardware by making extensive use of shaders to deliver high quality graphics.The system has been already tested by more than a hundred users with very diverse cultural backgrounds and it has received a positive feedback.","","De Amicis R,Girardi G,Andreolli M,Conti G","","2009","451","10.1145/1690388.1690499","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/1690388.1690499;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1690388.1690499","Conference Paper"

"Guidelines for Data Privacy Compliance: A Focus on Cyber-Physical Systems and Internet of Things","Privacy as a human right has been in existence for decades, but its effects are accentuated in the information age. Data privacy compliance in modern information technology applications is important, unavoidable, but complex, even more so for technologies (such as cyber-physical systems (CPSs) and Internet of Things (IoT)) that are enablers of the fourth industrial revolution, because of the covert nature of data collection involved. Organisations are not always equipped to comply with privacy requirements in such environments. This paper proposes a list of privacy compliance guidelines aimed at making it practical for organisations to comply with privacy legislation in these domains. The proposed guidelines can provide direction to organisations when carrying out a data privacy compliance exercise for CPSs and IoT. The guidelines take into account technical, organisational and legal aspects of data privacy compliance. Legal aspects are primarily based on the South African Protection of Personal Information Act 4 of 2013. Design science research, using literature analysis and expert opinion as data collection methods, was used as research approach.","","Baloyi N,Kotzé P","","2019","","10.1145/3351108.3351143","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3351108.3351143;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3351108.3351143","Conference Paper"
"HTK Analysis of Text-Based CAPTCHA Using Phonemic Restoration Effect and Similar Pronunciation with an Asian Accent","In Recent years, bot (robot) programs have been a threat on the web. Some kinds of the bots acquire accounts of web services in order to use the accounts for SPAM mails, phishing, etc. CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) is one of the countermeasures for preventing bots from acquiring the accounts. Especially, text-based CAPTCHA is applied to almost all famous web services since it can be implemented easily. However, CAPTCHA faces a problem that evolution of algorithms for analysis of printed characters disarms text-based CAPTCHA. Stronger distortion of characters is an easiest countermeasure of the problem. However, it makes recognition of characters difficult not only for bots but also for human beings. Therefore, we proposed a new CAPTCHA with resistance to the analysis by computers. We focus on the human abilities of phonemic restoration and recognition of similar pronunciation. Furthermore, we also pay attention to the fact that words with an Asian accent can be heard by English speakers. The proposed CAPTCHA makes machinery presumption difficult for bots, while providing easy recognition for human beings. In this paper, analysis of our CAPTCHA by computers with HMM (Hidden Markov Model) is evaluated.","","Goto M,Shirato T,Uda R","","2015","","10.1145/2701126.2701217","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/2701126.2701217;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2701126.2701217","Conference Paper"
"HearMeOut: Detecting Voice Phishing Activities in Android","In South Korea, voice phishing has been proliferating with the advent of voice phishing apps: the number of annual victims had risen to 34,527 in 2020, representing financial losses of approximately 598 million USD. However, the voice phishing functionalities that these abusive apps implement are largely understudied. To this end, we analyze 1,017 voice phishing apps and reveal new phishing functionalities: outgoing call redirection, call screen overlay, and fake call voice. We find that call redirection that changes the intended recipients of victims' outgoing calls plays a critical role in facilitating voice phishing; our user study shows that 87% of the participants did not notice that their intended recipients were changed when call redirection occurred. We further investigate implementations of these fatal functionalities to distinguish their malicious behaviors from their corresponding behaviors in benign apps. We then propose HearMeOut, an Android system-level service that detects phishing behaviors that phishing apps conduct in runtime and blocks the detected behaviors. HearMeOut achieves high accuracy with no false positives or negatives in classifying phishing behaviors while exhibiting an unnoticeable latency of 0.36 ms on average. Our user study demonstrates that HearMeOut is able to prevent 100% of participants from being phished by providing active warnings. Our work facilitates a better understanding of recent voice phishing and proposes practical mitigation with recommendations for Android system changes.","","Kim J,Kim J,Wi S,Kim Y,Son S","","2022","422–435","10.1145/3498361.3538939","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3498361.3538939;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3498361.3538939","Conference Paper"
"Human Factors Analysis for Aviation Accidents and Incidents in Singapore","The aviation industry is an important sector in contributing to a nation’s economy and its growth and development. The continuous improvement in the aviation industry with the adoption of new technology has developed trust and confidence amongst people all over the world. However even with such improvement and technological advances embedded in the aviation industry, accidents still cannot be avoided. An aviation accident is characterized as an incident that is directly related to an aircraft’s service. Aviation accidents are often the result of a number of causes and contributory factors, many of which have a human dimension to them. In some cases, human error is a factor in as high as 70% of aircraft accidents (Feggetter 2007). Hence, the challenge for accident investigators is how best to identify and mitigate the causal sequence of events leading up to an accident. The Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) is a general human error framework originally developed and tested within the USA military as a tool for investigating and analysing human causes of aviation accidents (Li et al. 2008). The applicability of HFACS to the analysis of large-scale datasets of incidents and accidents has also been demonstrated in both civil and military aviation environments in Taiwan, India and Australia. Further, this framework has been extended and adapted to analyse the underlying human factors causes in accidents involving remotely piloted aircraft, aviation maintenance and railroad accidents. In Asia, Singapore has a strong and robust economy and operates one of the world’s most successful and recognisable airlines. It is therefore surprising that little is known about human error in the aviation context. Thus, one purpose of the present study is to assess the utility of the HFACS framework as an error analysis and classification tool for accidents/incidents in the aviation industry in Singapore. Specifically, HFACS will be applied to commercial aviation accident and incident records maintained by the Transportation Safety Investigation Bureau (TSIB) of the Ministry of Transport (MOT). The TSIB is the air, marine and rail accidents and incidents investigation authority in Singapore. Its mission is to promote transport safety through the conduct of independent investigations into air, marine and rail accidents and incidents. A comprehensive review of 75 accidents and incidents that occurred between October 2000 and December 2019 in Singapore has just been undertaken. This is currently being analysed within a HFACS context and the findings will be reported here. Thus, the utility of the HFACS framework will be appraised, an overview of the 75 accidents will be given, and more specific detail relating to human error will be reported. At a later stage, these findings will be compared with other countries in Asia where similar data is available. Researchers claim that the HFACS framework bridges the gap between theory and practice by providing safety professionals with a theoretical tool for identifying and classifying human errors in aviation mishaps (Wiegmann and Shappell 2001a, b, c). The system focuses on both latent and active failures and their interrelationships, thereby facilitating the identification of the underlying causes of human error. The findings from this research will allow safety managers, administrators and other aviation professionals working in airlines, airports and aviation regulatory organizations to analyse their safety programmes’ strengths and weaknesses. This will also contribute to the build-up of a comprehensive database in Southeast Asia. Finally, this study is unprecedented in Singapore and will offer new insights into the nature and trends of human factors in aircraft accidents and incidents.","","Mohandas HR,Weng TK","","2021","308–323","10.1007/978-3-030-77932-0_25","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1007/978-3-030-77932-0_25;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-77932-0_25","Conference Paper"

"Improving Every Child's Chance in Life","This article describes the results of a data mining project designed to explore the key drivers of the Australian Early Development Index (AEDI), a numerical indicator of early childhood development vulnerability. The work was conducted during GovHack 2013, a 48-hour Australian Open Data competition where participants were required to use published open data sets provided by various Australian government and other agencies. We applied advanced machine learning techniques (random forests, generalised boosted regression models and multivariate adaptive regression splines) to the South Australian state and national data to gain insights into the key drivers of AEDI and to quantify the levers that the state government, community and individuals could apply to improve the situation. We found that after accounting for the population specifics and socioeconomic conditions, for example unemployment level and Index of Relative Socioeconomic Disadvantage, the most important factors impacting early childhood development were lack of motor vehicle in the household, inability to afford buying medication and maternal smoking during pregnancy. We quantified the impact of each of these factors and suggested relevant potential Government interventions. We then visualised our findings and created a Web app that allowed various intervention strategies to be interactively explored, based on the derived relationship between early child development index and its key drivers.","","Kolyshkina I,Brownlow M,Taylor J","","2013","180–184","","","Conference Paper"
"Including Stakeholder Input in Formulating and Solving Real-World Optimisation Problems","Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are becoming increasingly popular for solving formal environmental and water resources optimisation problems. In the past, the focus of these studies has generally been on methodological issues related to the optimisation algorithm. However, in recent years, there has been increased recognition of the need to apply these approaches to real-world problems to facilitate the realisation of their full potential. In order to assist with this, a framework for including stakeholder input in real-world optimisation problems is introduced in this paper, including a conceptual framework and a procedure for implementing it. The framework is applied to an urban water supply security study for Adelaide, South Australia. This study highlights the role of stakeholder input at the various stages of the optimisation process, as well as the resulting changes in the formulation, analysis and results. A discussion of the lessons learnt from the case study is also provided.

"Individualized Hiking Time Estimation","Route planning algorithms attempt to find the optimum path between two nodes in a graph, where a cost function specifies a weight for each edge. In many situations cost is related to distance or time. While time estimates are rather straightforward for automotive applications, real-world route planning for hiking and other outdoor activities requires careful consideration of a variety of different factors in order to produce reliable time estimates. Static estimates such as Naismith's Rule for estimating hike times do not consider individual factors such as a hiker's fitness or current progress along the trail. In this paper we address these aspects and develop a model for individual weight estimation that can be exploited in route planning applications. An evaluation conducted on GPS traces from hikes in South Tyrol, Italy indicates that the model can outperform Naismith's estimate by up to 23%.","","Pitman A,Zanker M,Gamper J,Andritsos P","","2012","101–105","10.1109/DEXA.2012.51","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1109/DEXA.2012.51;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/DEXA.2012.51","Conference Paper"

"Intelligent Autonomous System for Residential Water End Use Classification","Smart metering technology enables the capture of high resolution water consumption data.Intelligent algorithms autonomously categorise single and combined water end use events.Hybrid combination of HMM, ANN and DTW for pattern recognition problem.Expert system developed to autonomously disaggregate water use into end use categories. Over half of the world's population will live in urban areas in the next decade, which will impose significant pressure on water security. The advanced management of water resources and their consumption is pivotal to maintaining a sustainable water future. To contribute to this goal, the aim of this study was to develop an autonomous and intelligent system for residential water end-use classification that could interface with customers and water business managers via a user-friendly web-based application. Water flow data collected directly from smart water metres connected to dwellings includes both single (e.g., a shower event occurring alone) and combined (i.e., an event that comprises several overlapping single events) water end use events. The authors recently developed an intelligent application called Autoflow which served as a prototype tool to solve the complex problem of autonomously categorising residential water consumption data into a registry of single and combined events. However, this first prototype application achieved overall recognition accuracy of 85%, which is not sufficient for a commercial application. To improve this accuracy level, a larger dataset consisting of over 82,000 events from over 500 homes in Melbourne and South-east Queensland, Australia, were employed to derive a new single event recognition method employing a hybrid combination of Hidden Markov Model (HMM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm. The classified single event registry was then used as the foundations of a sophisticated hybrid ANN-HMM combined event disaggregation module, which was able to strip apart concurrently occurring end use events. The new hybrid model's recognition accuracy ranged from 85.9% to 96.1% for single events and 81.8-91.5% for combined event disaggregation, which was a 4.9% and 8.0% improvement, respectively, when compared to the first prototype model. The developed Autoflow tool has far-reaching implications for enhanced urban water demand planning and management, sustained customer behaviour change through more granular water conservation awareness, and better customer satisfaction with water utility providers.","","Nguyen KA,Stewart RA,Zhang H,Jones C","","2015","118–131","10.1016/j.asoc.2015.03.007","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1016/j.asoc.2015.03.007;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.asoc.2015.03.007","Journal Article"

While most efforts on in-vehicle research are generally focused within individual countries, this effort links a collaborative team from three diverse regions (i.e., Asia, American, and Europe). Details relating to the data collection paradigm, such as sensors, driver information, routes, and transcription protocols, are discussed, and a preliminary analysis of the data across the three data collection sites from the U.S. (Dallas), Japan (Nagoya), and Turkey (Istanbul) is provided. The usability of the corpora has been experimentally verified with a Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.74 for transcription reliability, as well as being successfully exploited for several in-vehicle applications. Most importantly, the corpora are publicly available for research use and represent one of the first multination efforts to share resources and understand driver characteristics.

"Investigating the Impact of Face Categorization on Recognition Performance","Face recognition is a key biometric technology with a wide range of potential applications both in government and private sectors. Despite considerable progress in face recognition research over the past decade, today’s face recognition systems are not accurate or robust enough to be fully deployed in high security environments. In this paper, we investigate the impact of face categorization on recognition performance. In general, face categorization can be used as a filtering step to limit the search space during identification (e.g., a person categorized as a middle-aged, Asian male, needs to be compared only to subjects having the same profile). Our experimental results demonstrate that face categorization based on important visual characteristics such as gender, ethnicity, and age offers significant improvements in recognition performance including higher recognition accuracy, lower time requirements, and graceful degradation. Additional performance improvements can be expected by implementing ”category-specific” recognition subsystems that are optimized to discriminate more accurately between faces within the same face category rather than faces between other categories.","","Veropoulos K,Bebis G,Webster M","","2005","207–218","10.1007/11595755_26","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1007/11595755_26;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/11595755_26","Conference Paper"
"Investigating the Roles and Competencies of a Tangible Game Facilitator","TANKS is a tangible coding game that introduces coding to South African learners of ages 10-14yrs. It is aimed to initiate and stimulate learning using facilitators. Facilitators use untraditional teaching methods because they are highly influential on the potential success of the training. Also, facilitators undertook face-to-face contact sessions since TANKS require the use of a smart phone and tokens. Applying the feed-forward learning flow model, a supportive school leadership by principal or teachers creates an academic coding culture, which then will necessitate learners’ competitive behaviour through the adoption of a performance-based appraisal practice, measured by each game level completed, in order to improve coding interest and TANKS performance by learners. A phenomenological qualitative study design approach of 6 facilitators of face-to-face interview using an adapted semi-structured questionnaire was used. All interviews were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis using an explanation building strategy was applied in this study. Results identified some themes such as: “understanding of tangible game”, “facilitator's lived experience”, “roles of a facilitator”, “learner experience”, “qualities of a facilitator”, “facilitator-learner communication”, “team vs individual work” and “facilitator's challenges”. Each theme is further explained in the study. Limitations included small interviewee numbers as the threat of a nationwide pandemic loomed. By applying the feed-forward learning flow model, we conclude that a supportive school leadership by principal or teachers creates an academic coding culture, which then will necessitate learners’ competitive behaviour through the adoption of a performance-based appraisal practice, in order to improve coding interest and TANKS performance by learners.","","Greyling J,Oluwaseyi Tokosi T","","2020","118–125","10.1145/3410886.3410894","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3410886.3410894;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3410886.3410894","Conference Paper"
"Iris Image Classification Based on Hierarchical Visual Codebook","Iris recognition as a reliable method for personal identification has been well-studied with the objective to assign the class label of each iris image to a unique subject. In contrast, iris image classification aims to classify an iris image to an application specific category, e.g., iris liveness detection (classification of genuine and fake iris images), race classification (e.g., classification of iris images of Asian and non-Asian subjects), coarse-to-fine iris identification (classification of all iris images in the central database into multiple categories). This paper proposes a general framework for iris image classification based on texture analysis. A novel texture pattern representation method called Hierarchical Visual Codebook (HVC) is proposed to encode the texture primitives of iris images. The proposed HVC method is an integration of two existing Bag-of-Words models, namely Vocabulary Tree (VT), and Locality-constrained Linear Coding (LLC). The HVC adopts a coarse-to-fine visual coding strategy and takes advantages of both VT and LLC for accurate and sparse representation of iris texture. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed iris image classification method achieves state-of-the-art performance for iris liveness detection, race classification, and coarse-to-fine iris identification. A comprehensive fake iris image database simulating four types of iris spoof attacks is developed as the benchmark for research of iris liveness detection.","","Sun Z,Zhang H,Tan T,Wang J","","2014","1120–1133","10.1109/TPAMI.2013.234","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1109/TPAMI.2013.234;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2013.234","Journal Article"

"Korea's Strategies for Mobile Technology Standards in Smart Ecosystem","Prior to the introduction of smartphones, South Korea's mobile market had already recognised the early construction of 3.5G technology HSDPA, WiBro, commercial networks, and advanced networks as an important strategy to gain competitive advantage over the market. With the emergence of a smart ecosystem, however, the competition over 4G technical standards is considered to be vital for securing the mobile operating systems and collaborations with participants within the ecosystem, such as the alliances between the devices and content providers. Thus, departing from the viewpoint that a mobile carrier-led network is required to make constant investments and improvements to help create a competitive advantage over the market. Hence, this study targets South Korea's mobile market, to analyse the different 4G mobile standard technologies that were simultaneously commercialised for the first time in the world, to examine the mobile carriers' strategies to dominate the 4G technical standards with the introduction of smartphones, and to provide implications derived from the study.","","","","2017","20–28","10.1504/IJAMC.2017.10004901","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1504/IJAMC.2017.10004901;http://dx.doi.org/10.1504/IJAMC.2017.10004901","Journal Article"
"LCMS: Design, Development and Implementing Experience","Finding a solution for e-learning is one of the main concerns of modern universities. The solution of this complex issue acquires broader approach included in the strategy of the institution. From the technical point of view it means building e-learning platform - e-learning system. E-learning platforms are applications used for delivery of learning content and facilitation of learning process. They are developed for administration and teaching in tertiary education. This software enables the administrators and lecturers to treat enrolment data electronically and offer electronic access to course materials. In addition to managing the administrative functions of online learning, some systems helps create, reuse, locate, deliver, manage, and improve learning content. These systems are called Learning Content Management Systems (LCMS). As part of the research project team, which aims to develop software for Learning Content Management System at SEE University, we primarily had to select the features that would cover our needs and also comply with the actual trends in this area and then design and develop the system. In this paper we present the in house development of an LCMS for South East European University, its architecture, conception and strengths.","","Abazi-Bexheti L","","2008","367–372","","","Conference Paper"
"Large Scale Measurement and Analytics on Social Groups of Device-to-Device Sharing in Mobile Social Networks","Recently many studies demonstrate that exploiting the Device-to-Device (D2D) content sharing in offline Mobile Social Networks (MSNs) is a promising solution to offload cellular data to local connectivities in proximity to reduce the duplicated cellular transmissions via the backbone network demanded by nearby users and hence to improve users' quality of service (QoS). However, related D2D-based social sharing and offloading proposals are based on either assumptions and theoretical models, or limited data-driven analysis caused by small scale of data sets (e.g. hundreds of MSN users) or single-dimensional feature (e.g. human mobility only), which severely restricts applications in practice. In this paper, we perform the large-scale measurement and analytics on D2D-based content sharing groups from the perspective of social networks via the platform of Xender, one of leading global D2D sharing platforms in Asia. This D2D sharing data is a precious offline social relationship that reflects the characteristics of large-scale offline users. We analyze the behaviors of about 40 million users with 443 million D2D transmissions of 17 million files in 865 thousand social groups, and unveil the details of social structure properties, network motifs, cascade trees of friendship and propagation which are helpful for improving social D2D sharing services.","","Wang S,Zhang Y,Wang H,Huang Z,Wang X,Jiang T","","2018","203–215","10.1007/s11036-017-0927-5","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1007/s11036-017-0927-5;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11036-017-0927-5","Journal Article"
"Linear Cryptanalysis of FF3-1 and FEA","Improved attacks on generic small-domain Feistel ciphers with alternating round tweaks are obtained using linear cryptanalysis. This results in practical distinguishing and message-recovery attacks on the United States format-preserving encryption standard FF3-1 and the South-Korean standards FEA-1 and FEA-2. The data complexity of the proposed attacks on FF3-1 and FEA-1 is O (Nr/2-1.5), where N2 is the domain size and r is the number of rounds. For example, FF3-1 with N=103 can be distinguished from an ideal tweakable block cipher with advantage ≥1/10 using 223 encryption queries. Recovering the left half of a message with similar advantage requires 224 data. The analysis of FF3-1 serves as an interesting real-world application of (generalized) linear cryptanalysis over the group Z/NZ.","","Beyne T","","2021","41–69","10.1007/978-3-030-84242-0_3","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1007/978-3-030-84242-0_3;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-84242-0_3","Conference Paper"
"Loss Estimation for Landslides in Mountain Areas - An Integrated Toolbox for Vulnerability Assessment and Damage Documentation","Global environmental change includes changes in a wide range of global scale phenomena, which are expected to affect a number of physical processes, as well as the vulnerability of the communities that will experience their impact. Decision-makers are in need of tools that will enable them to assess the loss of such processes under different future scenarios and to design risk reduction strategies. In this paper, a tool is presented that can be used by a range of end-users (e.g. local authorities, decision makers, etc.) for the assessment of the monetary loss from future landslide events, with a particular focus on torrential processes. The toolbox includes three functions: a) enhancement of the post-event damage data collection process, b) assessment of monetary loss of future events and c) continuous updating and improvement of an existing vulnerability curve by adding data of recent events. All functions of the tool are demonstrated through examples of its application. We developed a tool that will support decision making for disaster risk reduction strategies in mountain areas.The tool incorporates three functions: damage documentation, loss estimation and updating of the vulnerability curve.The tool was applied and tested in South Tyrol, Italy.Future developments (more elements at risks and hazards, uncertainty analysis, mobile applications) have been pointed out.","","Papathoma-Köhle M,Zischg A,Fuchs S,Glade T,Keiler M","","2015","156–169","10.1016/j.envsoft.2014.10.003","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1016/j.envsoft.2014.10.003;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2014.10.003","Journal Article"
"MAFIS Overlay Network: Towards a Secure Network for Mobile Automated Fingerprint Identification System over Virtual Private Network (VPN)","The Philippines is an archipelago or string of over 7,640 islands in southeastern Asia. With the community's active support, the Philippine National Police (PNP) is entrusted with upholding the law, preventing and controlling crimes, maintaining peace and order, and ensuring public safety and internal security. There are currently 1,766 police stations across the country. With the geographical challenges, criminal identification procedures take time to complete. The Mobile Automated Fingerprint Identification System (MAFIS) addresses the issues. MAFIS is currently deployed and implemented in a cloud platform that can be accessed by authorized police personnel from the web and mobile application to expedite fingerprint identification procedures. In today's world, the internet has become the de facto standard for low-cost communications architecture, as well as a significant convenience for organizations and businesses seeking to expand their operations. Because the internet is widely available in practically every region, companies frequently demand it for their local presence. As a result, a secure route within this communication network is required to ensure confidential data crossing the public network. The fast rise of digital gadgets and their Internet connectivity has resulted in security vulnerabilities to user data. Security and privacy threats have become more sophisticated day by day, increasing the demand for an updated and highly secure medium to secure entities and their valuable information on the internet. Advanced measures and high technical skills adapted by attackers, security, and privacy threats have become more sophisticated day by day, increasing the demand for an updated and highly secure medium to secure entities and their valuable information into the internet. There are other alternatives available on the market today, but the Virtual Private Network (VPN) is the most popular for establishing a secure connection over the public internet. Constructing a tunnel between the sender and receiver provides the convenience of a shared network while also providing the security of a private network. The researchers took advantage of the opportunity to create the MAFIS Overlay Network, a secure network design for MAFIS that runs over a virtual private network (VPN). Two VPN implementations were considered on the strategy: a site-to-site VPN connecting all of the law-enforcement agencies' remote offices and a remote-access VPN for the scene-of-the-crime operatives (SOCO). Speed and performance tests were performed using the industry-standard method to ensure the framework's consistency for mobile and web applications. The overall performance scores were 99 and 87 for web and mobile apps, respectively. The speed and performance test results acquired on all of the system's modules in three different criteria in terms of performance, interaction, and visual stability are significantly better than the recommended value and are thus considered highly acceptable. Overall, MAFIS has satisfactorily passed the security and compliance tests conducted and is reflected as highly satisfactory.","","Rey WP,Baccay MA","","2022","20–27","10.1145/3538806.3538812","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3538806.3538812;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3538806.3538812","Conference Paper"
"Managing the Shift in the Enterprise Perimeter in Order to Delay a Cybersecurity Breach","In the year, 2019, South African enterprises have seen a substantial increase in the number of cybersecurity incidents. From the public-sector to the private-sector, many enterprises have had to redirect large sums of their budgets towards responding to cybersecurity incidents that could have been averted. For most enterprises, having experienced, or seen the impact of a number of disclosed cybersecurity incidents in South Africa (SA) during 2019, the majority of enterprises had begun to strengthen their cybersecurity defenses in order to avert future cybersecurity incidents. To a large extent, most enterprises have implemented security measures such as firewalls, proxy gateways, patch management solutions, intrusions prevention or detection systems, encryption, network access control and so on. However, whilst these measures are implemented, in 2020, security architects saw a shift in the enterprise perimeter due to COVID-19 pandemic. Owing to the pandemic, on the 26th of March 2020, the South African government implemented a countrywide lock-down effectively enforcing all its citizens to stay at homes thus translating to an unintended remote workforce. During this time, employees found themselves overnight without any training working outside of the secured layered cybersecurity defenses of their enterprises. This arrangement negatively affected the security posture of many organizations. It effectively forced all enterprise employees to work from home, away from the secure enterprise network forcing information technology administrators to find ways to extend the enterprise perimeter in order to allow these inexperienced overnight remote workers to continue to securely work remotely. This article explores the consequences of the shift in the enterprise perimeter and also suggests practical technical steps that enterprises can apply in order to avert possible cybersecurity incidents.","","Mutemwa M,Masango MG,Gcaza N","","2021","","10.1145/3487923.3487925","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3487923.3487925;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3487923.3487925","Conference Paper"
"Mapping ICT Knowledge Infrastructure in South Asia","Information Communication Technology (ICT) has a significant impact on the socioeconomic development of a country. However, the inequitable access to ICT still remains a major issue in developing countries. In this context, this study examines ICT knowledge infrastructure in South Asia from a network point of view. Existing research on ICTs are useful in understanding the common facts, but are limited in revealing the hidden structures and properties of the ICT research domain in South Asia. The hidden structures and properties, like key players, network of key players for scientific collaborations, and their network characteristics are analyzed and synthesized in this study. This study applies the mixed approach of Social Network Analysis techniques and Triple Helix indicators on scholarly papers obtained from the Web of Science database. Further, burst detection algorithm is applied on keywords appearing in the titles of the South Asian ICT scholarly papers to understand the emerging trends in the ICT research domain. This study helps in providing a better understanding of current trends, strengths, and weaknesses of ICT in South Asia, which provides a better understanding to bridge the digital divide and achieve socioeconomic development through ICT.","","Swar B,Khan GF","","2014","117–137","10.1007/s11192-013-1099-0","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1007/s11192-013-1099-0;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-013-1099-0","Journal Article"

"Migrating Agile Development into the Cloud Computing Environment","The emergence of cloud computing is influencing how businesses develop, re-engineer, and implement critical software applications. The cloud requires developers to elevate the importance of compliance with security policies, regulations and internal engineering standards in their software development life cycles. Cloud computing and agile development methodologies are new technologies that have come with new approaches in the way computing services are provisioned and development of quality software respectively. However, the synergy between the two is bonded with technical and non-technical challenges. In this paper, a conceptual framework is proposed to support the process of migration of South African small, medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs) who are using agile software development methodologies to cloud computing environment.","","Mwansa G,Mnkandla E","","2014","818–825","10.1109/CLOUD.2014.113","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1109/CLOUD.2014.113;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CLOUD.2014.113","Conference Paper"
"Minority Entrepreneurship 2.0","Research on minority entrepreneurship often proceeds by documenting discriminatory barriers impeding business creation and performance. Acquiring appropriate human capital, accessing financing, and exploiting market opportunities have been more challenging for minorities than for White business owners. Particularly regarding Black-owned firms, studies examining barriers impeding their viability invariably identify the presence of those barriers. Findings portray afflicted businesses suffering in ways manifested by their lower survival rates, firm size, employee numbers, and the like – firms shackled by blatantly racist practices. Inadequately addressed is the question of why these beaten-down firms have made such impressive progress in recent decades. The applicable constraints, in fact, have lessened.Regarding the factors shaping entrepreneurial performance, economists focus heavily on persistent racial inequality while sociologists have stressed pathways to immigrant ethnic inclusion, i.e., group adaptation to life in America. Both paradigms have validity. Black, Latino, and Asian American business owners are diverse groups often impacted in differing ways by America’s evolving discriminatory barriers. The fact that most Asian and Latino owners are immigrants, some here illegally, presents complications. This monograph proceeds by probing the differing circumstances under which Black, Asian, and Latino owners run their firms and ways in which these differences shape their performance outcomes.","","Bates T","","2022","423–582","10.1561/0300000101","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1561/0300000101;http://dx.doi.org/10.1561/0300000101","Journal Article"
"Misbehavior Detection in Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems Using Temporal Fusion Transformer","The United States in the early 20th century became the first nation to introduce the concept of intelligence in the transportation systems followed by intensive research and development by the European Countries like (Sweden, Switzerland), Japan, South Korea in the similar area. Since 1991, Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) have been an emerging and promising area of research. This fact is also aided by the recent advancement and developments in the field of automated driving systems over the past few years. Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITS) is the latest advancement over the existing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) as now the systems are making use of communication and interaction with infrastructure using connected and automated vehicles (CAV’s) in order to create helpful and exciting applications that concern road safety, environment, mobility. Trust and Node Cooperation are the most crucial factors on which C-ITS relies as the decisions that are taken by a vehicle are based on the data and information it gets from the network infrastructure that is installed on the roadsides which is basically a pool of information which has been gathered from other vehicles and smart infrastructures that are part of the VANET. Presence of any misbehaviour in the network or a compromised node in the transport network system will lead to atrocious results for both traffic and network safety. Detecting any misbehaviour in the network can save us a lot of resources that will go into creating a system that can defend the complete network against a threat. Through the medium of our thesis project we will be detecting misbehaviour in the system using Deep Learning techniques. A most Basic MLP Neuron Architecture based Artificial Neural Network (ANN) would serve as our baseline and proposed models include LSTM and Transformer Model which will be used for time series classification.","","Goyal A,Bhatia A,Yadav A,Sharma DK","","2023","431–437","10.1145/3571306.3571448","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3571306.3571448;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3571306.3571448","Conference Paper"
"Mo(Bile) Money, Mo(Bile) Problems: Analysis of Branchless Banking Applications","Mobile money, also known as branchless banking, leverages ubiquitous cellular networks to bring much-needed financial services to the unbanked in the developing world.

We then perform a comprehensive manual teardown of the registration, login, and transaction procedures of a diverse 15% of these apps. We uncover pervasive vulnerabilities spanning botched certification validation, do-it-yourself cryptography, and other forms of information leakage that allow an attacker to impersonate legitimate users, modify transactions, and steal financial records. These findings show that the majority of these apps fail to provide the protections needed by financial services. In an expanded re-evaluation one year later, we find that these systems have only marginally improved their security. Additionally, we document our experiences working in this sector for future researchers and provide recommendations to improve the security of this critical ecosystem.

"Mobile Communication for Emerging Bangladesh: Exploring the Privacy Risks for Youth Population","Connectivity in social and economic spheres using mobile technology is a global phenomenon. This kind of communication is more significant for Southern Countries: a mean to develop, a way to come out of poverty, and a path towards an equitable society. This relationship between new communication technologies and society is complex, primarily due to their multidimensional effects in personal and social lives. Absence of a proper policy guideline and infrastructure to nurture the mobile communications' potentials can leave the users at risk of privacy violations in an increasingly flattened world. Youths of the developing societies, who have a very high representation in ICT usage hence face greater risks in terms of privacy violation and involuntary personal data commodification. This paper, as a part of a multi-year study, specifically looks into the vulnerability of Bangladeshi youth population using mobile devices, for voice and data communications. Bangladesh, one of the emerging economies in South Asia, has a thriving Telecom/ICT industry with an ever growing number of users, majority of them being young. Based on a nationwide representative survey, we have found the level of trust on existing mobile telephony to be significantly higher than the Internet across the country among all respondents, amid the absence of any clear privacy and security framework at the national level. This paper moreover shows that a significant number of the younger generation (both male and female) are unaware about the concept of privacy in the 'Digital Age' and also have little or no idea about possible risks involved with sharing any voice or data communication.","","Hussain F,Ullah MS","","2012","211–216","10.1145/2346536.2346577","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/2346536.2346577;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2346536.2346577","Conference Paper"
"Mobilizing for Change: Simulating Political Movements in Armed Conflicts","Theories on the establishment and propagation of political movements through mobilization have emerged and evolved over the last half century. Among the major theoretical frameworks that have been advanced are resource mobilization theory, political process theory, and culture theory. However, despite these developments, relatively few methodological approaches have applied bottom-up computational modeling and simulation in explaining movement development in conflicts. With developments made in computational methods, the integration of social theory with modeling and simulation is a natural progression in creating tools that allow analysts, policy makers, and researchers the means to assess the successes or failures of political movements during armed struggles. This article presents an agent-based model and simulation that applies several frequently used theoretical approaches to political mobilization and explores the extent to which group resources and identity shaped conflicts in Central Asia. Given their historical, cultural, political, economic, and geographical circumstances, the authors seek to determine why different movements experienced contrasting political mobilization outcomes. Results show that receiving outside resources could help a relatively weak group, with limited mobilization, overcome opposition that is initially better mobilized, while shared identity and sufficient risk taking are shown to be potentially strong factors in producing successful mobilization. More broadly, the approach advanced enables analysts and researchers to better anticipate future mobilization events and projected paths of conflict by developing and understanding cause and effect relationships within relevant theoretical frameworks.","","Altaweel M,Sallach D,Macal C","","2013","143–164","10.1177/0894439312451106","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1177/0894439312451106;http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0894439312451106","Journal Article"
"Modeling Choices in Nuclear Warfighting: Two Classroom Simulations on Escalation and Retaliation","Two classroom simulations-SUPERPOWER CONFRONTATION and MULTIPOLAR ASIAN SIMULATION-are used to teach and test various aspects of the Borden versus Brodie debate on the Schelling versus Lanchester approach to nuclear conflict modeling and resolution. The author applies a Schelling test to segregate high from low empathic students, and assigns them to hard case positions in three simulations to test whether high empathy students can engage in tactic bargaining and whether low empathetic students are necessarily as escalation prone. He has a bipolar nuclear simulation that is an easy case for the Brodie set of assumptions about nuclear war, avoidance, and Schelling-esque tacit bargaining. He expects the system structure and high empathy leader selection to contain escalation, despite the temptation of relying on accelerated Single Integrated Operational Plan solutions and the counterincentive of diminished tacit bargaining through decapitation attacks. The second simulation is a multipolar nuclear simulation set in the near future of Asia, and emulates the Borden-esque logic of nuclear war as artillery exchanges, with a Lanchester square law logic encouraging rapid escalation, coupled with a selection for the most autistic leadership. The author expects rapid nuclear escalation under these structural and decision-making conditions. His conclusions are anecdotal, but seem to indicate, from student feedback during class discussions, that the failure to model fear may be a factor in undermining successful tacit bargaining by players, suggesting that Borden rather than Brodie better conceptualized nuclear conflict. Therefore, peace is about restraining war initiation, as there are great pressures for escalation once war is initiated.","","Schofield J","","2013","73–93","10.1177/1046878112455488","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1177/1046878112455488;http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1046878112455488","Journal Article"
"Modeling Research on the Sorption Kinetics of Pentachlorophenol (PCP) to Sediments Based on Neural Networks and Neuro-Fuzzy Systems","The sorption kinetics of pentachlorophenol (PCP) to sediments (from 8 different lakes, south of China) was studied in batch experiments. The comparison of a radial basis function neural network (RBFN) and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) applied for modeling the sorption behaviors was presented. Although the physical and chemical characteristics were different, the modeling results showed that the sorption behaviors of 8 different sediments were similar. Both RBFN and ANFIS could model the sorption behaviors and make predictions in high accuracy, which illustrated that the two models reflected the internal principle of the sorption better than the traditional model Fick's second law (FSL). Especially, RBFN held the promise of being able to work under noisy conditions to obtain high accuracy. In conclusion, RBFN was the valid options for modeling the sorption kinetics of PCP to the lake sediments. The individual changes of the three different inputs (the concentration of PCP in the aqueous phase, the reversible fraction and the irreversible fraction) affected the modeling results to the similar extent, from which we could infer that the sorption kinetics of PCP to these sediments were affected by all the three factors rather than only by the concentration of PCP in the aqueous phase.","","Su XK,Zeng GM,Huang GH,Li JB,Liang J,Wang LL,Du CY","","2007","239–247","10.1016/j.engappai.2006.06.016","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1016/j.engappai.2006.06.016;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.engappai.2006.06.016","Journal Article"
"Preservation of Evidence in Case of Online Gaming Crime","Along with the rapid growth of network applications and digital contents, online gaming has become a very successful industry in recent years. It not only brings tremendous business opportunities but also attracts marvelous customers to be online players. However, due to the lack of virtual property protection and related information security schemes, more and more players have violated the law because of its real world profit. Unfortunately, online gaming crime has turned out one of the most serious cybercrimes in many countries, such as in Taiwan, South Korea, China, and so on. In order to solve this judicial problem and effectively protect virtual property, we propose a Virtual Property Description Language (VPDL) as the syntax to record and express virtual property. There are six models, including Identity Model, Ownership Model, Trading Model, Content Model, Revocation Model, and Security Model. It can effectively protect virtual property and strengthen the competence of digital evidence by recording the legal source, ownership, trading track, and handling of virtual properties so as to lower the cases of online gaming crime. The online gaming companies may use it in the aspects of virtual property management, tracing historic records and collecting legal digital evidence, while the existing system mechanism of online game doesn't need to be changed.","","Chen PS,Hung CY,Ko CH,Chen YC","","2008","229–244","10.1007/978-3-540-69304-8_23","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1007/978-3-540-69304-8_23;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-69304-8_23","Conference Paper"
"Privacy Vulnerabilities in Public Digital Service Centers in Dhaka, Bangladesh","This paper joins a growing body of work within ICTD and related fields studying the privacy challenges in the Global South. While most of the existing work in this area has focused on uses of technology in personal and home settings, a large part of computing in the Global South centers around public places, such as commercial Digital Service Centers (DSCs). In this paper, we present the findings from a six-month-long ethnography studying 19 Digital Service Centers in Dhaka, Bangladesh. We find that infrastructural limitations, local power politics, lack of knowledge, and insufficient protection mechanisms lead to privacy vulnerabilities for the customers of these centers. We apply the lens of informal markets to analyze these vulnerabilities and connect our findings to the broader concerns of ICTD around development, ethics, and postcolonial computing and discuss potential design and policy implications around these issues.","","Haque SM,Haque MR,Nandy S,Chandra P,Al-Ameen MN,Guha S,Ahmed SI","","2020","","10.1145/3392561.3394642","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3392561.3394642;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3392561.3394642","Conference Paper"
"Privacy during Pandemic: A Global View of Privacy Practices around COVID-19 Apps","A large number of mobile phone applications have been built and deployed to combat COVID-19, offering various services to users, including virus information, contact tracing, and symptom monitoring among others. At the same time, the privacy and security vulnerabilities of user data over these apps have become a big concern in many places. To examine this issue, we conducted a mixed-method study with a combined approach of app analysis and an online survey to understand the privacy vulnerabilities of such apps and get an overview of user perceptions around this issue. In addition, we considered the notion of privacy in two different socio-economic contexts (Global North and Global South) to specify similarities and differences in app-specific privacy functionalities (data practices, functional requirements, regulations, etc.) and identify factors that impacted users’ decision to use such apps (such as trust, preferences, concerns, motivations, etc.). Thus, this paper presents two diverse sets of opinions from these two geographic regions (including 27 countries), which provide a broader understanding of how the privacy concerns around COVID-19 are connected to various economic, political, and social factors. Furthermore, our analysis of 39 apps provides a deep insight into what many COVID-19 apps are lacking to ensure proper privacy practices and how those issues are entangled with various contextual challenges.","Yes","Sharma T,Islam MM,Das A,Haque SM,Ahmed SI","","2021","215–229","10.1145/3460112.3471958","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3460112.3471958;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3460112.3471958","Conference Paper"
"Prototyping and Transforming Facial Textures for Perception Research","Transforming facial images along perceived dimensions (such as age, gender, race, or health) has application in areas as diverse as psychology, medicine, and forensics. We can use prototype images to define the salient features of a particular face classification (for example, European female adult or East-Asian male child). We then use the differences between two prototypes to define an axis of transformation, such as younger to older. By applying these changes to a given input face, we can change its apparent age, race, or gender. Psychological investigations reveal a limitation with existing methods that's particularly apparent when changing the age of faces. We relate the problem to the loss of facial textures (such as stubble and wrinkles) in the prototypes due to the blending process. We review the existing face prototyping and transformation methods and present a new, wavelet-based method for prototyping and transforming facial textures","","Tiddeman B,Burt M,Perrett D","","2001","42–50","10.1109/38.946630","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1109/38.946630;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/38.946630","Journal Article"
"Research on the City Network Structure in the Yellow River Basin in China Based on Two-Way Time Distance Gravity Model and Social Network Analysis Method","Modern cities form city networks through complex social ties. City network research is widely applied to guide regional planning, infrastructure construction, and resource allocation. China put forward the Yellow River Basin Development Strategy in 2019, but no research has been conducted on regional social connections among cities. Based on the gravity model modified by two-way “time distance” between cities, this is the first study to empirically examine the intensity and structure of the entire city network in the Yellow River basin using the social network analysis method and ArcGIS software. The connection rules of the cross-city transfer of city officials in the basin are also investigated to illustrate the official ties between cities. The results suggest that the intensity of two-way connections between cities is generally low in the Yellow River basin and there is a positive correlation between city network development level and regional economic development level. The development gap between cities on the north and south banks is larger than that between the east and west regions, and some cities in the middle and upper reaches of the river are marginalized in the network. The status of the central cities in the Yellow River basin is distinct, but their connecting and leading abilities are not strong, showing an inverted T-shaped spatial distribution. The subgroups of city networks have strong internal connections, while the connection among subgroups is weak and the development shows a partitioned and fragmented pattern, making it difficult to form linkages among the upper, middle, and lower reaches. The “beaded chain” spatial development strategy can be adopted in the river basin planning, giving priority to strengthening the links within subgroups of cities and among adjacent subgroups, building central city chains, and reinforcing the overall basin management.","","Chai D,Zhang D,Sun Y,Yang S,Xiong F","","2020","","10.1155/2020/6680954","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1155/2020/6680954;http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2020/6680954","Journal Article"
"Retrieving Dental Radiographs for Post-Mortem Identification","Automating the process of postmortem identification of deceased individuals based on dental characteristics is receiving increased attention. With the large number of victims encountered in mass disasters (e.g., Asian tsunami), automating the identification process would enhance the scalability of this biometric. However, archiving and retrieving dental records from large databases is a challenging task and has received inadequate attention in the literature. This paper concerns itself with the task of efficient fast retrieving dental records from a database in order to assist the forensic expert in identifying deceased individuals in a rapid manner. The proposed method is an appearance-based technique that consolidates the evidence presented by individual teeth in a dental record, i.e., it 'moves' from tooth-to-tooth in order to render a recordto-record matching score. The proposed method is shown to reduce the searching time of record-to-record matching by a factor of hundred. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach requires significantly less time compared to the other approaches suggested in the literature thereby underscoring its relevance in real-time applications.","","Abaza A,Ross A,Ammar H","","2009","2509–2512","","","Conference Paper"
"Risk Analysis and Vulnerability Assessment of Archeological Areas for the Preventive Conservation","The territorial structure of archaeological sites is often compromised by a variety of factors which, over time, can contribute to aggravate the deteriorating conditions of the archaeological areas. Natural disasters, often, have caused irreversible damage (crashes, loss of finds, etc.) at the archeological sites. The paper shows the results of research aimed at developing an innovative risk assessment model, oriented to sustainability criteria, that can provide help in making decisions process about the protection, conservation and valorisation of archaeological areas. The proposed work presents a logical and operative model suitable to estimate the actual risk condition for archeological sites developed by integrating the information concerning vulnerability of archeological areas and the danger condition of the sites upon which they are located. The determination of the risk, derived from the evaluation of potential co-presence of independent sources of danger within a given geographical area, has been modeled by a type of approach multi hazard.The methodology is applied at the case study of archaeological area of Sybari in Calabria Region, in south of Italy, where tried to develop an integrated and coordinated cognitive methodology - evaluation within an overall information system for assessing the vulnerability of archaeological heritage and environmental dangerousness in order to identify the level of risk which is under the archaeological area in relation to the territory of reference.The results obtained allow to relate the risk with the risk factors, the detection of damage on archaeological heritage in question, determine the tolerance threshold within which it is possible the preservation of goods and to propose a synthesis strategy between environmental protection and sustainable exploitation.","","Quattrone G","","2016","157–168","10.1007/978-3-319-48496-9_13","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1007/978-3-319-48496-9_13;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-48496-9_13","Conference Paper"
"Rolling the Dice on Theory: One Department's Decision to Strengthen the Theoretical Computing Aspect of Their Curriculum","For today's undergraduate computer science students, topics such as computer graphics, security, game design, and others are areas that typically have the most interest. As educators know, properly teaching these advanced topics is not possible without students having learned fundamental skills such as programming, problem solving and by gaining a background in theoretical computer science. While innovations have occurred in the way to teach programming, teaching theoretical computer science remains difficult. Part of the problem is that many students view this area as difficult and postpone taking these courses until late in their program. Furthermore, the topics are seen by students as not very exciting and they cannot see their applications. At Indiana University South Bend, three core courses in the computer science curriculum are deemed primarily theoretical (Foundations of Digital Computing, Programming Languages, and Analysis of Algorithms). While the department has been satisfied with the latter two courses, the first course has been a source of frustration for many years. In its current incarnation, the Foundations course is four credits and the faculty assigned to teach it have consistently said that there is not enough time to cover all of the necessary topics. This past year the department met regularly to discuss the course and decided to take steps to substantially improve the theoretical aspects of the curriculum. New courses were proposed and adopted, changes to other courses were considered, and a move to make a course acceptable as a campus-wide critical thinking course was approved and enacted. This paper describes these changes and chronicles the challenges faced in adopting them.","","Surma DR","","2012","74–80","","","Journal Article"
"Russian Phonetic Variability and Connected Speech Transcription","The study of pronunciation variability is an important phonetic task, which has many applications (in speech synthesis and recognition systems, language teaching, forensic phonetics, etc.), and well-known variability of Russian speech deserves special investigations. Generally, one may distinguish geographical, functional, social and national variability of pronunciation. At the same time any type of pronunciation is characterised byits own internal variability. It concerns as well the standard speech. Database of contemporary Russian speech variability is currently being created in the Laboratory of the Experimental Phonetics of St. Petersburg University in order to investigate pronunciation variance of different speech types. The database of sound material is formed by recordings of the Phonetically Representative Texts pronounced by 1) standard Russian speakers, 2) regional Russian speakers, 3) speakers from the former USSR republics to which Russian is a second language, and 4) foreigners from European, Asian and American countries. Along with the sound database, an expert linguistic system is being created, which allows analysis and investigation of particular speech samples, types and corresponding parameters. An important role here plays the system of speech transcription, which should adequately reflect the actual variability.","","Kusnetsov VI,Sherstinova TY","","2000","243–247","","","Conference Paper"
"SLIM-Detector for Undersampling Preamble in Underwater Acoustic Communications","The preamble is the signal to trigger the receiver to change from the standby mode to the working mode. Preamble detection is a very important part for underwater acoustic communications, since if the preamble signal is not detected or the receiver is triggered wrongly by inteferences, the whole communication will fail[6][7].Matched filter (MF) [5] is widely used for sonar detection. It correlates the transmitted with received waveform to determine whether and when a target appears. The MF has a very simple formulation, and is optimal in additive white noise in probing a stationary target since it gives the highest output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) among all FIR filters in White Gaussian Noise (WGN). The Page test (PT)[1] is used to improve the detection performance in the nonstationary underwater channel with the slowly changing noise level and multiple echoes for active sonar systems. Besides, the normalized matched filter (NMF)[3] relies on the matching of the signal shapes for detection, minimizes the influence of unknown SNR which is more practical than the MF in complicated underwater environments. Other anti-interference detectors for preamble in underwater multipath channel are proposed [7][4][9] to further improve the detection.All the above traditional detectors are based on assumption that the Nyquist frequency is absolutely met. However, the underwater systems usually need to be low power-consuming, especially in standby mode. And undersampling processing can lower the power, cost and even storage for preamble in standby mode. Hence undersampling preamble detection calls for studying for underwater acoustic modems. Undersampling makes signal aliasing and lose much feature, hence it leads traditional detection failure.Doppler-insensitive waveforms[10] such as hyperbolic frequency modulation (HFM) or linear frequency modulation (LFM) are often used as the probing waveforms for target detection in radar and sonar applications and preambles in communications. Undersampling processing can seriously weaken the detection of these wideband signals.In this work, we propose a new detector named Sparse Learning via Iterative Minimization(SLIM)-detector. SLIM is proposed for sonar location in [8]. It can collect echoes from Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO). In our work we use this principle to collect and strengthen energy from underwater multipath channel. With SLIM-detector, energy of preamble is strengthened after iterations in SLIM, then collected. Even if the undersampling makes the signal aliasing, we can still separate preamble from different interferences and noise.SLIM-detector works different from SLIM. The initialization part of SLIM-detector is similar to NMF which presents a rough model for detection. The iterative part of SLIM-detector is the main part of SLIM estimator. In this part, the strongest paths become stronger after each iteration and the weak paths become weaker. This can also help us distinguish real paths of preamble signals from false alarms under aliasing caused by undersampling. One of the challenges to put this detector into practical use is that the original assumption for SLIM is under WGN. Therefore interferences can bring outliers which can lead the detection into failure. As we know, normalization can lower the false matching for MF. Here we add another normalization step after the iterations to further lower the false alarms of interferences. Another challenge to make the detector practical is that a reasonable signal template is crucial. The iterations make the matching very sensitive. This is a benefit if the template is good enough, but can also be a weakness when the template is too rough. A good template should try to cover all the possible delays and Doppler-shifts of preamble signals. However this will lead to a large dimensional signal template and low efficiency. Here also comes to why we choose HFMs as our preamble signals: it is Doppler-insensitive, and the Doppler-shift in it can be converted into a time-delay. Hence we only need to consider the coverage of the possible delay in signal template. Besides, the threshold is also difficult to obtained in practice. The normalization step helps us to limit it into a small range. Empiric value can be recommended from simulations and experiments.The experimental results show the performance of SLIM-detector under undersampling condition. In the experimental data, the HFM signal with 5kHz bandwidth comes from the test in Qiandao Lake, Zhejiang, China, in 2017, full of multipath. The impulsive interference data sets were collected from the sea experiment conducted in May 2013, in the South China Sea, near Kaohsiung City, Taiwan.Other data sets of interferences are collected from the Mobile Acoustic Communication Experiment (MACE10), which was held in June 2010 off the coast of Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts. After downsampling, the sampling frequency of received preamble becomes 5kHz. It is much lower than Nyquist frequency. SNR is --6 dB. In Figure 1, SLIM-detector is robust against undersampling, while other conventional detectors totally fail in some interferences due to the aliasing effect. Results show SLIM-detector can be used as an efficient detector for the undersampling preamble signal.","","Wang X,Li W,Wang X,Li X","","2020","","10.1145/3366486.3366541","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3366486.3366541;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3366486.3366541","Conference Paper"
"Seamless Access in Asia Pacific: Opportunities and Challenges","One of the factors driving the technological revolution in wireless communications and Internet access is the unbridled global demand for voice, video, and data services. Changes from an industrial to an informational based society and the associated demand for enhanced communications services push the need for seamless access further. Currently, the domestic telecom service market is divided between fixed-line and mobile providers. As such, not only networks, but also operators and services are evidently divided into two markets. To meet the challenges of fixed-mobile convergence (FMC), carriers will have to radically rethink their approaches to new products and services development. They will need to create a varied portfolio of products and services and the ability to bring these to markets in weeks rather than months to gain competitive advantages. This study discusses the opportunities to exploit in Asia Pacific region in respect to FMC services deployment. It also addresses challenges faced by the key players in Asia Pacific region. In short, it is aimed to provide an extensive study on the opportunities and challenges that could be used to derive architecture for key players in the industry to outline suitable approaches to encourage mass market diffusion of FMC services in Asia Pacific.","","Wong CC,Low AL,Hiew PL","","2006","30–34","","","Conference Paper"
"Searching for People through Textual and Visual Attributes","Searching for people through their personal traits has been largely required for several areas and, consequently, has become the center of attention in the scientific community. Locating a suspect or finding missing people in a public space are some of the practical applications which take advantage of research conducted in this topic. In this paper, we propose the use of describable visual attributes (e.g., male, wear glasses, has beard), as labels that can be assigned to an image to describe its appearance. The approach is based on visual dictionaries to generate an intermediate representation for the face images. We train binary classifiers for the attributes which give to each image a score used to obtain its ranking. However, there are some attributes that have no immediate antagonistic (e.g., asian people). Then, we evaluate unary classifiers for such attributes. The method is easily extensible to new attributes. For queries consisting of more than one attribute, we use two approaches of the state-of-the-art to combine the rankings: product of probabilities and rank aggregation. Experimental results show that incorporating visual dictionaries improves the accuracy for some attributes. Furthermore, for many attributes, rank aggregation achieves better results than traditional methods of rank fusion. The proposed solution might be of interest in a forensic scenario for searching suspects in a database by means of textual descriptions provided by a victim.","","Fabian J,Pires R,Rocha A","","2012","276–282","10.1109/SIBGRAPI.2012.45","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1109/SIBGRAPI.2012.45;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SIBGRAPI.2012.45","Conference Paper"
"Security Trade-off and Energy Efficiency Analysis in Wireless Sensor Networks","With a rapid progress of numerous applications in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), performance evaluation and analysis techniques face new challenges in energy efficiency area in WSN applications. One of the key issues is to perform the security trade-off and energy efficiency analysis. In this paper, the energy analysis module for the QoP-ML (quality of protection modeling language) is proposed by means of which one can analyze the influence of various security levels on the energy consumption of a protocol. Moreover, an advanced communication module is proposed as an extension of the QoP-ML language, which enhances the abilities to analyze complex wireless sensor networks. The case study of WSN deployed on the Jindo Bridge in South Korea was carried out and the lifetime of protocols with various security levels was simulated. The results show that the introduction of various security levels can entail large differences in performance and energy consumption, and hence result in different lifetime. Therefore, the designers of WSN protocols should search for balance between the required lifetime and security level. The introduced QoP-ML extension, along with the AQoPA (automated quality of protection analysis) tool, has been developed to meet the above requirements.","","Rusinek D,Ksiezopolski B,Wierzbicki A","","2015","","10.1155/2015/943475","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1155/2015/943475;http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2015/943475","Journal Article"

In this paper, we test the validity of using such universal security defenses, with a particular focus on culture. We apply the previously proposed Security Behavior Intentions Scale (SeBIS) to 3,500 participants from seven countries. We first translate the scale into seven languages while preserving its reliability and structure validity. We then build a regression model to study which factors affect participants' security behavior. We find that participants from different countries exhibit different behavior. For instance, participants from Asian countries, and especially Japan, tend to exhibit less secure behavior. Surprisingly to us, we also find that actual knowledge influences user behavior much less than user self-confidence in their computer security knowledge. Stated differently, what people think they know affects their security behavior more than what they do know.","","Sawaya Y,Sharif M,Christin N,Kubota A,Nakarai A,Yamada A","","2017","2202–2214","10.1145/3025453.3025926","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3025453.3025926;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3025453.3025926","Conference Paper"

"Social Dimensions in the Acceptance of and Access to Technology: A Usability Study in a Collaborative Security Application","Technological ubiquity and advances in the use of networked devices, such as smartphones, have become a fundamental element in the dynamics of information in the social environment. Social problems can be discussed in these networks, receiving the aid from these devices, in order to unite community members in a network that is strengthened for common goals, transforming the local reality. The motivation for this work lies in the fact that lack of security is one of the problems that have most afflicted Brazilians in recent years. From this reality, the main objective of this study is the development of a usability analysis model that is suitable for smartphone applications and that allows identifying of the viability of using a collaborative security application in the social context of a city in the south of Minas Gerais. Data collection was performed through the application of two questionnaires, one being a demographic survey and the other to evaluate usability with a focus on users' perception of the use of the application. The application usage scenario is family safety facing the challenges of mitigating public security issues. The analysis of the results was based on the reinterpretation of usability from the perspective of the Theory of Innovation Diffusion and the Recursive Model of Access to Technology. As a result, the study enabled conclusions pointing that this type of interpretation allows us to glimpse horizons that go beyond explicit aspects of usability, helping to understanding environmental and social factors inherent to the context of technological diffusion in a developing society.","","de Oliveira M,Mattedi AP,Seabra RD","","2019","","10.1145/3357155.3358431","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3357155.3358431;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3357155.3358431","Conference Paper"

"Spatio-Temporal Factor Analysis of Characterizing Mass Protest Events Using Taxi Trajectory in Seoul, Korea","Recently from October, 2016 until April, 2017 in Seoul, South Korea, a series of protests have occurred on almost every Saturdays, where crowds estimated from 50,000 to 2.3 million have gathered in streets around palatial Gwanghwamun Square due to a political scandal of former president Park Geun-hye. In total, nearly 16.5 million crowds have attended to these events by holding candles aloft with wishes for an immediate resignation of the former president. With respect to these consecutive events in South Korea, we present a research with a goal of finding spatiotemporally the most influential factors for the characterization of event size (i.e. the number of participants) by using Seoul taxi trajectory data. For this objective, an analysis was conducted that finds the optimal combination of variables which maximizes dissimilarity measures among event size categories by utilizing Dunn's Index (DI) as an evaluation function, for which Genetic Algorithm (GA) was used due to combinatorial computation complexity of the optimization problem. As a result, the most governing regions and time bins with respect to three taxi statuses: drop off, pick up, passing with and without passenger were found for event size categories. Based on the analysis, we could come up with a reverse engineering approach which can find a list of influential factors of taxi trajectory data for characterizing event size. The influential factors could be used for traffic control and transit service plans for city administrators. The proposed approach can be applied to any other set of given clusters having many variables that requires huge amount of combinations to pick governing factors for such characterization problems.","","Ma JW,Ju S,Nguyen HM,Yun SB,Yoon S,Heo J","","2017","","10.1145/3148044.3148050","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3148044.3148050;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3148044.3148050","Conference Paper"
"Specification-Based Intrusion Detection System for WiBro","WiBro (Wireless Broadband), the service based on the IEEE 802.16e (mobile WiMAX) standard, is a wireless broadband Internet technology developed by the South Korean telecommunications industry. In this paper, we analyze security vulnerabilities of the WiBro standard, focusing on the initial authentication phase and propose a specification-based intrusion detection system that can detect those vulnerabilities. We first derive specifications from the normal operational process of the initial authentication based on PKMv2 EAP-AKA and formalize the derived specifications as a state transition diagram. The proposed system executes the intrusion detection based on those specifications and the state transition diagram. In this paper, to verify the detection capability of the proposed system, we construct an experimental network and execute scenario-based tests.","","Lee Y,Yoo SG,Kim J,Lee S","","2011","445–455","","","Conference Paper"
"Strategic Exploring of Emerging Services by Visualization of Technology-Service Association for Technology-Based Service Providers","As the technical progress has been saturated, the convergence of technologies or the fusion of technologies has changed the business circumstances of technology-based service providers whose goal is the delivery of technically advanced services. It is required to explore potential technology-based service markets with the technology exploitation. Because of characteristics of the technology-based services, it should be examined from two viewpoints such as technology-push and customer-pull. For exploring a whole landscape for potential service markets based on the technology, we use visualization as an aid to connect technologies and services. Our visualization method enables to understand positions of emerging technologies and services, evaluate the marketability of services, and identify the opportunities or risks of the future service markets strategies. And we applied our method for the service portfolio management of a network service provider in South Korea.","","Pyon CU,Park SC","","2010","4301–4312","10.1016/j.eswa.2009.11.070","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1016/j.eswa.2009.11.070;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2009.11.070","Journal Article"
"The Application of Optimal Control Theory in Stabilizing Mine Grid","In order to make system as possible as near target value in given time according to requisite control effect,....ontrol function can be selected based on the principle of optimal control in this paper. According to maximum principle of Hamilton function, required optimal control can be obtained from the solution of the nonlinear differential equation. Reason stabilization running on interior area power grid of mining office of steady running mechanism was researched using this optimal control, and dynamic characters of the whole mining office power grid analyzed. Applying optimal control theory, steady measure can be carried into execution together in south and north grid so as to prevent the change of system from the load disturbance effectively. Finally, the example as improvement of the power grid of interior mining office illustrates that the stability of power grid is both to guarantee the security production of mine and to increase economic benefits.","","Gao X,Yang G","","2006","533–536","10.1109/ICICIC.2006.165","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1109/ICICIC.2006.165;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICICIC.2006.165","Conference Paper"
"The Early International Activities in the Arpanet, Its Mutation into the Internet, and Some Further Regional Extensions","This talk will consider some of the activities involved in setting up the International Internet and its precursors. It will consider later efforts in promoting the technology in regions that it had not reached earlier. There will be consideration not only the technical development, but also the political climate which either encouraged or prevented its take-up. Moreover, the importance of personal networks at many stages of the story will be highlighted. I will consider why the first Arpanet service node was sited at UCL, how it grew to provide an international heterogeneous interconnection service until the late '80s, and how this differed from other European developments. This will include the governance put in place, the role of the Open Systems Interconnection rise and fall in Europe, and the growth of multi- agency support on both sides of the Atlantic. In parallel with the development of a UK-US service, an International Collaboration Board (ICB) was formed that fostered unclassified collaborations between certain European and American NATO defence departments. While the ICB was not very significant technically, how its success initiated broader US-European Internet extension will be described. Our emphasis on application services to the '90s will be outlined - message, directory, security and multimedia conferencing. Finally we will treat briefly the start of international networking in India around 1990, and the bringing the academics of Central Asia and the Caucasus into the Internet community.","","Kirstein PT","","2018","573–574","10.1145/3241539.3241588","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3241539.3241588;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3241539.3241588","Conference Paper"
"The Effects of Ubiquitous Healthcare Service on the South Korean Economy: Using Input---Output Analysis","Due to the rapid market penetration of smartphones and the development of context-aware ubiquitous healthcare services, the demand for ubiquitous healthcare service--to monitor patients' longitudinal health data continuously and cope with emergency situations--has rapidly increased. Recent developments have suggested that researchers need to provide policy-makers with accessible and reliable information regarding the role of ubiquitous healthcare services. The objective of this study is to investigate the impact of ubiquitous healthcare services on the South Korean economy, using a static input---output approach. We address topics relating to the input---output model, such as the demand-driven model and inter-linkage effects, and the components inherent in an unconventional input---output model, such as the supply-driven model and the Leontief price model. The results indicate that the ubiquitous healthcare industry as a final primary production sector has strong production-inducing effects, weak price ripple effects, and marginal backward and forward linkage effects. It is also found that the industry is closely related to the electric and electronic device sector and the precision machinery sector. This is largely attributable to the convergence characteristics of industries that use wireless telecommunications, as well as those of the medical and measurement device and medical service sectors.","","Kim YJ,Kim CY,Shin YJ","","2017","1149–1160","10.1007/s10796-016-9640-3","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1007/s10796-016-9640-3;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10796-016-9640-3","Journal Article"
"The European Community and Information Technology","The world has watched Eastern Europe erupt into such political turmoil that historians are expected to call this period the Revolutions of 1989. Economic evolution was also underway as the Continent progressed toward a single European market. The goal—a market without national borders or barriers to the movement of goods, services, capital and people—was first outlined over 30 years ago by the 12 countries which became members of the Common Market. In the mid 1980s, the effort was renewed when these same countries approved an ambitious plan outlining hundreds of legislative directives and policies that would harmonize and re-regulate those of the member states. The measures are drafted by the European Commission, voted on by the Council of Ministers, amended if necessary, and then assigned budgets by the Parliament. They include competition law, labor law, product regulation and standardization, taxation and subsidies, and quota and tariff guidelines. In 1987, the Single European Act created a timetable for the passage of legislation with a formal deadline for the removal of barriers by December 31, 1992, hence the term Europe '92 (EC '92). But many have described EC '92 as a process that will continue throughout the 1990s. The ouster of communist leaderships throughout Eastern Europe, however, has raised unexpected questions about the participation of the Eastern countries, and this could alter or delay the process.Nevertheless, the changes have begun and are taking place during the Information Revolution. It is therefore natural to ask what impact EC '92 will have on the computer industry. Inevitably, several of the directives and policies relate primarily, and many secondarily, to information technology. Table 2 lists the policies in effect and those being proposed. In the following pages, Communications presents several points of view regarding the impact of EC '92 on the information technology market in Europe.As of July 1988, the European information systems market was estimated at $90 billion by Datamation magazine and is expected by many to be the fastest growing market this decade. But during the last ten years, European-based computer companies have had difficulty keeping pace with American and Japanese firms. In 1988, European companies managed only a 20 percent market share on their own turf, according to market researcher International Data Corporation. Not much had changed since 1982 when their market share was 21 percent. As reported in the Wall Street Journal last January, European computer companies have been hindered by lack of economies of scale, narrow focus on national markets, and difficulty in keeping pace with Japanese and IJ.S. product innovations. But the occasion for the Journal article was the news that Germany's Siemens AG was merging with the ailing Nixdorf Computer AG. The result would possibly be the largest computer company based in Europe, and the sixth or seventh largest in the world. And in October of 1989, France's Groupe Bull announced the purchase of Zenith Electronics Corporation's personal computer unit. Bull claimed that it would become the sixth largest information service company in the world. Such restructurings have been predicted with the approach of EC '92, as corporate strategies would begin to take into account directives and trade rules regarding the computer and telecommunications industries. Smaller European and American computer companies are anticipating battle with giants like IBM and DEC, which have long-established European divisions or subsidiaries. IBM has been the leader in mainframes, minicomputers, and personal computers, but it is expected that all computer companies, European-based or not, will face greater competition in Europe.The Netherlands' NV Philips, the largest European semiconductor and consumer electronics company, says it has been preparing for EC '92 since the 1970s. And North American Philips Chairman Gerrit Jeelof has claimed company credit for initiating the 1987 European Act. In a speech delivered at a Business Week and Foreign Policy Association Seminar last May, Jeelof said that while American companies had forsaken consumer electronics, Philips and France's Thompson have held their own against the Japanese. But he indicated that American dominance of the European semiconductor market was a major impetus for EC '92. Jeelof said: . . . because of the lack of European strength in the field of computers, the integrated circuits business in Europe is dominated by Americans. Europe consumes about 34 percent of all ICs in the world and only 18 percent are made in Europe by European companies. The rest are made by American companies or are imported. It is not a surprise then that in 1984 we at Philips took the initiative to stimulate a more unified European market. At the time, we called it Europe 1990. Brussels thought that 1990 was a bit too early and made it 1992. But it has been the electronics industry in Europe together with other major companies, that have been pushing for Europe 1992. Why did we want it? We wanted a more homogeneous total market in Europe and, based on that, we wanted to become more competitive. The process is on its way and obviously we see some reactions. If you take action, you get reaction.One reaction has been concern on the part of non-European companies and their governments that the EC is creating a protectionist environment, a “Fortress Europe.” As walls between nations are coming down, some fear that other more impenetrable ones are going up on the Continent's edges. Jeelof argues against this perception in another speech, “Europe 1992—Fraternity or Fortress,” reprinted in this issue in its entirety.Communications also presents an analysis of several trade rules relating to semi-conductors in “The Semiconductor Market in the European Community: Implications of Recent Rules and Regulations,” by Roger Chiarodo and Judee Mussehl, both analysts in the Department of Commerce Office of Microelectronics and Instruments. The authors outline the consequences of Europe's Rules of Origin, anti-dumping measures that are supposed to prevent companies from using assembly operations in an importing country to circumvent duty on imported products. In the United States, if the difference between the value of parts or components from the dumping country and the value of the final product is small, then duty will be placed on those parts or components used in U.S. assembly operations. By contrast, the EC rule says that if the value of parts or components exceeds 60 percent of the value of all parts and materials, then duty will be placed on those parts and materials upon assembly in Europe. Since 1968, origin was also determined according to “the last substantial process or operation” resulting in the manufacture of a new product. In the case of printed circuit boards, some countries interpreted this as assembly and testing, while others thought it meant diffusion. In 1982, the EC began harmonizing these interpretations, and as of 1989, the last substantial operation was considered diffusion: the selective introduction of chemical dopants on a semiconductor substrate. As a result, American and Japanese semi-conductor manufacturers have spent millions building foundries on European soil. To reveal the Japanese interpretation of such changes, Japanese Commerce Minister Eiichi Ono, with the Japanese Embassy in Washington, DC, expresses his country's impressions of EC '92 in this issue. In his speech, “Japan's View of EC '92,” delivered at an Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association (AFCEA) conference on Europe '92, Ono states that while the EC's intentions might not be protectionist, they could become so upon implementation. His discussion focuses on semi-conductors and technology transfer issues.Although not a formal directive, in July 1988, the European Council decided to promote an internal information services market (the last “L” document in Table 2). To present the reasoning and objectives behind this initiative, we reprint the Communication from the Commission to the Council of Ministers, “The Establishment at Community Level of a Policy and a Plan of Priority Actions for the Development of an Information Services Market,” and the resulting July 1988 “Council Decision” itself. Funds allocated for 1989 and 1990 are approximately $36 million, $23 million of which was slated for a pilot/demonstration program called IMPACT, for Information Market Policy Actions. This may seem a pittance in comparison to the programs of other governments, but this Decision and other EC legislation are the first steps toward an EC industrial policy. Recognizing that Europe's non-profit organizations and the public sector play a very important role in providing database services, in contrast to the U.S. where the private sector is now seeding the production of such database services, IMPACT has prepared guidelines to help the public sector cooperate with the private sector in marketing information. These guidelines would also allow private information providers to use public data and add value to it to create commercial products. IMPACT is providing incentives to accelerate innovative services for users by paying 25 percent of a project's cost. After the first call for proposals, 16 of 167 projects proposed by teams composed of 300 organizations were funded. American-based companies can apply for funds if they are registered in Europe. Unlike the U.S., the EC allows registration regardless of who owns a company's capital. Projects funded are to develop databases that would be accessible to all members of the Community either on CD-ROM or eventually on a digital network, an ISDN for all Europe, as planned by the fifth recommendation listed in Table 2. One project in the works is a library of pharmaceutical patents on CD-ROM that will enable users to locate digitized documents. Users will also have direct access to on-line hosts for all kinds of patents. A tourism information database and a multi-media image bank of atlases are other pilot projects chosen, and another project will provide information on standards. Eventually, audiotext might be used to retrieve data by telephone instead of a computer terminal. When the initial projects have been completed, the Commission will inform the market place about the results of the implementation. Plans for a five-year follow-up program, IMPACT-2 are also under discussion.These projects depend to some extent on the implementation and passage of directives or the success of larger and better funded projects. On-line access to databases depends on the recommendation for an ISDN as well as on the standardization directive for information technology and telecommunications. The certification, quality assurance, and conformity assessment issues involved in that directive are too numerous and important to just touch on here and will be covered in a later issue of Communications. To make these databases accessible not only technically, but also linguistically, the EC has funded two automatic language translation projects called Systran and Eurotra. Systran is also the name of the American company in La Jolla, CA, known for its pioneering work in translation. In conjunction with the EC, Systran Translation Systems, Inc., has completed a translation system for 24 language pairs (English—French, French—English, for example, are two language pairs) for the translation of IMPACT- funded databases. The system resides on an EC mainframe; there will be on-line access by subscription; and it will also be available on IBM PS/2s modified to run VMS DOS. It is already on France's widespread Minitel videotext network.As this practical, market-oriented approach to technology implementation is beginning, Europe's cooperative research effort, ESPRIT, is also starting to transfer its results. Last year, the second phase, ESPRIT II, set up a special office for technology transfer. Its mission is to ensure the exploitation, for the benefit of European industry, of the fruits of the $1.5 billion ESPRIT I program that began in 1984, as well as the current $3.2 billion program (funding through 1992). The EC contributes half of the total cost, which is matched by consortia comprised of university and industry researchers from more than one country. About 40 percent of ESPRIT II's funds will be devoted to computer related-technologies.Every November, ESPRIT holds a week-long conference. Last year for the first time it devoted a day to technology transfer. Several successful technology transfers have occurred either from one member of the program to another or out of the program to a member of industry that had not participated in the research. An electronic scanner that detects and eradicates faults on chips, for example, was developed by a consortium and the patents licensed by a small company. This automatic design validation scanner was co-developed by CSELT, Italy, British Telecom, CNET, another telecom company in France, IMAG, France, and Trinity College, Dublin. The company that will bring it to market is ICT, Gmbh, a relatively small German company. It seems that in Europe, as in the United States, small companies and spin-offs like those found in the Silicon Valley here, are better at running quickly with innovative ideas, says an EC administrator.Another technology transfer success is the Supernode computer. This hardware and software parallel processing project resulted in an unexpected product from transputer research. The Royal Signal Radar Establishment, Inmos, Telmat, and Thorn EMI, all of the UK, APTOR of France, and South Hampton University and the University of Grenoble, all participated in the research and now Inmos has put the product on the market.Three companies and two universities participated in developing the Dragon Project (for Distribution and Reusability of ADA Real-time Applications through Graceful On-line Operations). This was an effort to provide effective support for software reuse in real-time for distributed and dynamically reconfigurable systems. The researchers say they have resolved the problems of distribution in real-time performance and are developing a library and classification scheme now. One of the companies, TXT, in Milan, will bring it to market.Several other software projects are also ready for market. One is Meteor, which is aimed at integrating a formal approach to industrial software development, particularly in telecommunications. The participants have defined several languages, called ASF, COLD, ERAE, PLUSS, and PSF for requirements engineering and algebraic methods. Another project is QUICK, the design and experimentation of a knowledge-based system development tool kit for real-time process control applications. The tool kit consists of a general system architecture, a set of building modules, support tools for construction, and knowledge-based system analysis of design methodology. The tool kit will also contain a rule-based component based on fuzzy logic. During the next two years, more attention and funds will be indirectly devoted to technology transfer, and the intention to transfer is also likely to be one of the guides in evaluating project proposals.Some industry experts maintain that high technology and the flow of information made the upheaval in Eastern Europe inevitable. Leonard R. Sussman, author of Power, the Press, and the Technology of Freedom: The Coming Age of ISDN (Freedom House, 1990), predicted that technology and globally linked networks would result in the breakdown of censorious and suppressive political systems. He says the massive underground information flow due to books, copiers, software, hardware, and fax machines, in Poland for example, indicates that technology can mobilize society. Knowing that computers are essential to an industrial society, he says, Gorbachev faced a dilemma as decentralized computers loosened the government's control over the people running them. Glasnost evolved out of that dilemma, says Sussman.Last fall, a general draft trade and economic cooperation accord was signed by the European Commission and the Soviet Union. And both American and Western European business interests are calling for the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM) to relax high technology export rules to the Eastern Bloc and the Soviet Union. The passage of that proposal could allow huge computer and telecommunications markets to open up. And perhaps the Revolutions of 1989 will reveal themselves to have been revolutions in communication and the flow of information due in part to high technology and the hunger for it.","","Frenkel KA","","1990","404–410","10.1145/77556.77557","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/77556.77557;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/77556.77557","Journal Article"

"The Smoothing Effect of the ANOVA Decomposition","We show that the lower-order terms in the ANOVA decomposition of a function f(x)@?max(@f(x),0) for x@?[0,1]^d, with @f a smooth function, may be smoother than f itself. Specifically, f in general belongs only to W""d"","" ^1, i.e., f has one essentially bounded derivative with respect to any component of x, whereas, for each u@?1,...,d, the ANOVA term f""u (which depends only on the variables x""j with j@?u) belongs to W""d"","" ^1^+^@t, where @t is the number of indices k@?1,...,d@?u for which @?@f/@?x""k is never zero. As an application, we consider the integrand arising from pricing an arithmetic Asian option on a single stock with d time intervals. After transformation of the integral to the unit cube and also employing a boundary truncation strategy, we show that for both the standard and the Brownian bridge constructions of the paths, the ANOVA terms that depend on (d+1)/2 or fewer variables all have essentially bounded mixed first derivatives; similar but slightly weaker results hold for the principal components construction. This may explain why quasi-Monte Carlo and sparse grid approximations of option pricing integrals often exhibit nearly first order convergence, in spite of lacking the smoothness required by the conventional theories.","","Griebel M,Kuo FY,Sloan IH","","2010","523–551","10.1016/j.jco.2010.04.003","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1016/j.jco.2010.04.003;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jco.2010.04.003","Journal Article"
"Towards Designing Secure Online Games","The multiplayer gaming industry has become very successful in Asia. With the growth of online gaming, there has been an amazing growth in online gamingrelated crime, especially in Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs) [1]. In Taiwan, more than 37% of criminal cases relate to online gaming crime with most offenders in the age range of 15-20 years [5]. Most of these crimes can be attributed to the fact that these online games were not designed to be secure. This paper applies a design for security approach to MMORPGs and then examines what crimes could have been avoided if the games were designed to be secure from the beginning. The approach also uncovers some potential new threats and gives countermeasures for them.","","Yee G,Korba L,Song R,Chen YC","","2006","44–48","10.1109/AINA.2006.333","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1109/AINA.2006.333;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/AINA.2006.333","Conference Paper"
"Towards Improving the Accuracy of Telugu OCR Systems","Design of a high accuracy OCR system is a challenging task as the system performance is affected by its component modules. Each module has its own impact on the overall accuracy of the OCR system. An improvement in a module reflects upon overall system performance. In the present work, we have developed an OCR system for Telugu. Our experiments on a corpus of about 1000 images has shown that the system performance is degraded due to broken characters caused by the binarization module as well as due to improper character segmentation. Therefore, we address the issues of handling broken characters and poor segmentation. A novel approach which is based on feedback from the distance measure used by the classifier is proposed to handle broken characters. For character segmentation, our proposed approach exploits the orthographic properties of Telugu script. As a result, significant improvement is obtained in the performance of the system. These algorithms are generic and may be applicable to other Indian scripts, especially to south Indian scripts. In our experiments, an end-to-end system performance is evaluated which is not reported in the literature.","","Kumar PP,Bhagvati C,Negi A,Agarwal A,Deekshatulu BL","","2011","910–914","10.1109/ICDAR.2011.185","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1109/ICDAR.2011.185;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICDAR.2011.185","Conference Paper"
"Towards a Modular Brain-Machine Interface for Intelligent Vehicle Systems Control – A CARLA Demonstration","Objective: Individuals with paralysis often have mobility and dexterity impairments that limit their ability to operate motor vehicle controls. Integrating brain-machine interface (BMI) neurotechnology with vehicle control systems (VCS) provides a novel solution to this problem. In this proof-of-concept study, we show that an intracortical BMI developed to restore voluntary grasp can be repurposed to decode motor intention for vehicle velocity and steering control. Methods: The BMI-VCS consists of four components: 1) implanted motor cortex microelectrode array and NeuroPort data acquisition system, 2) machine learning workstation, 3) Python interface to generate control signals, and 4) vehicle control system. Results: Direct cortical steering and velocity control were achieved through accurate decoding of movement intention (supination, pronation, hand open, hand close) from the participant’s motor cortex, translating intention into vehicle commands (turn right, turn left, accelerate, decelerate, respectively), and dynamically switching between commands to turn corners, start and stop, shift from forward to reverse, and parallel park. Conclusion: By translating BMI decoder outputs into high-level vehicle commands, a participant with tetraparesis from C5 ASIA A spinal cord injury successfully navigated CARLA driving simulator courses in real time. These decoder outputs could also be used offline for shared control of a scale model car. Significance: High-level, shared vehicle control with BMI-VCS offers an innovative way to return independent driving abilities to those with disability. BMI systems that can control multiple end-effectors may be particularly useful to those with paralysis.","","Dunlap C,Franklin R,Gerhardt M,Ravindran A,Hassani A,Filev D,Solzbacher F,Bockbrader M,Bird L,Burkhart I,Eipel K,Colachis S,Annetta N,Ganzer P,Sharma G,Friedenberg D","","2019","277–284","10.1109/SMC.2019.8914317","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1109/SMC.2019.8914317;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SMC.2019.8914317","Conference Paper"
"Understanding MNEs' Decline in the Adoption of Locally Developed Technology Standard in China","Asian countries are becoming more and more active in participating technology standard development. In this paper we study the impact of this change on multinational enterprises (MNEs) using the case of TD-SCDMA, an international technology standard of 3G mobile communications. During the development of this technology standard, MNEs' market share dropped dramatically. A major contribution of this study is analyzing the underlying mechanism governing MNEs' interpreting TD-SCDMA as a threat rather than an opportunity by integrating two streams of literature. We also discuss the possible strategies for MNEs to maintain their market leadership position when local firms are able to lead international technology standard development. Asian countries such as Korea and China are becoming more and more active in participating technology standard development.An under-researched area is the impact of the development of home grown technology standards from Asian countries on MNEs.With the official adoption of TD-SCDMA in 2009, MNEs market share declined significantly.MNEs have to re-conceptualize and re-position themselves when host countries are able to develop technology standards.","","Gao X,Gerst M,Sun R","","2014","878–889","10.1016/j.telpol.2014.09.008","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1016/j.telpol.2014.09.008;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.telpol.2014.09.008","Journal Article"
"Usably Secure, Low-Cost Authentication for Mobile Banking","This paper explores user authentication schemes for banking systems implemented over mobile phone networks in the developing world. We analyze an authentication scheme currently deployed by an Indian mobile banking service provider which uses a combination of PINs and printed codebooks for authenticating users. As a first step, we report security weaknesses in that scheme and show that it is susceptible to easy and efficient PIN recovery attacks. We then propose a new scheme which offers better secrecy of PINs, while still maintaining the simplicity and scalability advantages of the original scheme. Finally, we investigate the usability of the two schemes with a sample of 34 current and potential customers of the banking system. Our findings suggest that the new scheme is more efficient, less susceptible to human error and better preferred by the target consumers.","","Panjwani S,Cutrell E","","2010","","10.1145/1837110.1837116","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/1837110.1837116;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1837110.1837116","Conference Paper"
"Using Educational Technology to Implement Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol® for Asian Business/Computer Students","President Lee Myung-Bak's initiative regarding Korean schools teaching all subjects in English by 2010 may have been temporarily hamstrung by, among others, Korean teachers fearful for their job security, but ultimately this goal will prove to be not only a boon to but also inevitable for the country's continued economic growth. Currently, most college/university teachers and students alike in Korea are admittedly unprepared for an efficacious combination of content (e.g., computer science) and language (i.e., English) instruction. Researchers at a renowned ""vocational college"" near Seoul believe they have the solution to this problem: using educational technology to implement a customized version of Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol (SIOP®), a methodology widely used to teach subject content in English to speakers of other languages. Although SIOP® is not necessarily by design dependent on educational technology utilization, techniques involving hardware/software applications are recommended for several reasons, just one of them being cost effectiveness. SIOP®'s eight major components are used as a structure for identifying both the most pressing problems and promising solutions. The majority, if not all, of these findings should, via extrapolation and especially customization, be useful to Asian and indeed all schools facing similar difficulties regarding Business/Technology Teaching In English (BTTIE).","","Deeds DW,Lee Y","","2008","941–947","10.1109/ICCIT.2008.16","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1109/ICCIT.2008.16;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICCIT.2008.16","Conference Paper"

"Using Smart Cards in Electronic Commerce","Smart cards have been in use for over two decades mainly for storing small amount of money. People carried them to pay for telephone calls, transport ation, photocopying in libraries and alike. These cards become very popular in Europe and Asia. Recently, the use of smart cards expanded considerably. For example, in several countries smart cards are used as identification cards which include information ranging from health status and insurance and to retirement benefits. The latest development in smart cards technology is its Internet related applications, which are mostly related to the support of payment systems and security.","","Mcelroy D,Turban E","","1998","61–72","10.1016/S0268-4012(97)00040-6","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1016/S0268-4012(97)00040-6;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0268-4012(97)00040-6","Journal Article"
"WAVNet: Wide-Area Network Virtualization Technique for Virtual Private Cloud","A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a secure collection of computing, storage and network resources spanning multiple sites over Wide Area Network (WAN). With VPC, computation and services are no longer restricted to a fixed site but can be relocated dynamically across geographical sites to improve manageability, performance and fault tolerance. We propose WAVNet, a layer 2 virtual private network (VPN) which supports virtual machine live migration over WAN to realize mobility of execution environment across multiple security domains. WAVNet adopts a UDP hole punching technique to achieve direct network connection between two Internet hosts without special router configuration. We evaluate our design in an emulated WAN with 64 hosts and also in a real WAN environment with 10 machines located at seven different sites across the Asia-Pacific region. The experimental results show that WAVNet not only achieves close-to-native host-to-host network bandwidth and latency, but also guarantees more effective VM live migration than existing solutions.","","Xu Z,Di S,Zhang W,Cheng L,Wang CL","","2011","285–294","10.1109/ICPP.2011.90","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1109/ICPP.2011.90;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICPP.2011.90","Conference Paper"
"We Don't Give a Second Thought Before Providing Our Information: Understanding Users' Perceptions of Information Collection by Apps in Urban Bangladesh","With a rapid increase in the use of digital technologies, people in the Global South including Bangladesh are exposed to a wide-range of smartphone applications (termed as apps in this paper), which offer a variety of features and services. However, privacy leakage through apps has increasingly become a major concern in Bangladesh, where the app collecting users' sensitive information without their consent was reported in news media for privacy violation. Our study with 32 participants from varying age, literacy level, and profession in Dhaka, Bangladesh unveils the perceptions of people around data collection and sharing by the app reported in privacy leakage news. All of our participants were aware of information leakage through the app they use, where they possess varying perceptions around providing personal information, like a sense of benefit, necessity and contribution, indifference, fear, or (no) authority over data collection. Our analysis reveals the relation between users' privacy perceptions, local infrastructure, and social practices in Bangladesh, where we identify the situated challenges that interfere with people's understanding of privacy notice. Our results lead to a discussion on how people's privacy perceptions are influenced by rapid urbanization and the opportunities offered by digitization in Bangladesh. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations to develop situated and sustainable strategies to enhance privacy awareness and practices in the social setting of Bangladesh, and Global South.","Yes","Al-Ameen MN,Tamanna T,Nandy S,Ahsan MA,Chandra P,Ahmed SI","","2020","32–43","10.1145/3378393.3402244","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3378393.3402244;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3378393.3402244","Conference Paper"
"We've Looked at Clouds from Both Sides Now","Cloud Computing is a versatile technology that can support a broad-spectrum of applications. The low cost of cloud computing and its dynamic scaling renders it an innovation driver for small companies, particularly in the developing world. Cloud deployed enterprise resource planning (ERP), supply chain management applications (SCM), customer relationship management (CRM) applications, medical applications and mobile applications have potential to reach millions of users. Cloud deployed applications that employ mobile devices as end-points are particularly exciting due to the high penetration of mobile devices in countries like China, South Africa and India. With the opportunities in cloud computing being greater than at any other time in history, we had to pause and reflect on our own experiences with cloud computing--both as producers and consumers of that technology. Our interests and attitudes toward cloud technology differ considerably for each side of the cloud-computing topic. As producers of cloud-like infrastructure, much of our interest was on the technology itself. We experimented with algorithms for managing remote program invocation, fault tolerance, dynamic load balancing, proactive resource management and meaningful distributed application monitoring. As consumers of cloud computing however, our focus switched from interesting technology to usability, simplicity, reliability and guaranteed rock solid data stability. With an eye to the many cloud articles in the recent news, we have to ask, is cloud computing ready for prime time? After reviewing stories about current cloud deployments, we conclude that cloud computing is not yet ready for general use, many significant cloud service failures have been reported and several important issues remain unaddressed. Furthermore, besides the failures and gaps in the current cloud offerings, there is an inherent flaw in the model itself. Today, the cloud represents an opportunity for a client to outsource hardware/software function or program computing cycles. The missing piece is responsibility outsourcing--today something found only in IT Outsourcing contracts. This missing piece represents an essential component of a cloud offering. Without it, cloud consumers are left without any real reassurances that their data is safe from failures, catastrophe or court ordered search and seizure. In this paper, we explore the different viewpoints of cloud computing. Leveraging our experiences on both sides of clouds, we examine clouds from a technology aspect, a service aspect and a responsibility aspect. We highlight some of the opportunities in cloud computing, underlining the importance of clouds and showing why that technology must succeed. Finally, we propose some usability changes for cloud computing that we feel are needed to make clouds ready for prime time.","","Lehman TJ,Vajpayee S","","2011","342–348","10.1109/SRII.2011.46","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1109/SRII.2011.46;http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SRII.2011.46","Conference Paper"
"Webometrics: Evolution of Social Media Presence of Universities","This paper aims at an important task of computing the webometrics university ranking and investigating if there exists a correlation between webometrics university ranking and the rankings provided by the world prominent university rankers such as QS world university ranking, for the time period of 2005–2016. However, the webometrics portal provides the required data for the recent years only, starting from 2012, which is insufficient for such an investigation. The rest of the required data can be obtained from the internet archive. However, the existing data extraction tools are incapable of extracting the required data from internet archive, due to unusual link structure that consists of web archive link, year, date, and target links. We developed an internet archive scrapper and extract the required data, for the time period of 2012–2016. After extracting the data, the webometrics indicators were quantified, and the universities were ranked accordingly. We used correlation coefficient to identify the relationship between webometrics university ranking computed by us and the original webometrics university ranking, using the spearman and pearson correlation measures. Our findings indicate a strong correlation between ours and the webometrics university rankings, which proves that the applied methodology can be used to compute the webometrics university ranking of those years for which the ranking is not available, i.e., from 2005 to 2011. We compute the webometrics ranking of the top 30 universities of North America, Europe and Asia for the time period of 2005–2016. Our findings indicate a positive correlation for North American and European universities, but weak correlation for Asian universities. This can be explained by the fact that Asian universities did not pay much attention to their websites as compared to the North American and European universities. The overall results reveal the fact that North American and European universities are higher in rank as compared to Asian universities. To the best of our knowledge, such an investigation has been executed for the very first time by us and no recorded work resembling this has been done before.","","Sarwar R,Zia A,Nawaz R,Fayoumi A,Aljohani NR,Hassan SU","","2021","951–967","10.1007/s11192-020-03804-y","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1007/s11192-020-03804-y;http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-020-03804-y","Journal Article"
"White Rabbit in Mobile: Effect of Unsecured Clock Source in Smartphones","With its high penetration rate and relatively good clock accuracy, smartphones are replacing watches in several market segments. Modern smartphones have more than one clock source to complement each other: NITZ (Network Identity and Time Zone), NTP (Network Time Protocol), and GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) including GPS. NITZ information is delivered by the cellular core network, indicating the network name and clock information. NTP provides a facility to synchronize the clock with a time server. Among these clock sources, only NITZ and NTP are updated without user interaction, as location services require manual activation. In this paper, we analyze security aspects of these clock sources and their impact on security features of modern smartphones. In particular, we investigate NITZ and NTP procedures over cellular networks (2G, 3G and 4G) and Wi-Fi communication respectively. Furthermore, we analyze several European, Asian, and American cellular networks from NITZ perspective. We identify three classes of vulnerabilities: specification issues in a cellular protocol, configurational issues in cellular network deployments, and implementation issues in different mobile OS's. We demonstrate how an attacker with low cost setup can spoof NITZ and NTP messages to cause Denial of Service attacks. Finally, we propose methods for securely synchronizing the clock on smartphones.","","Park S,Shaik A,Borgaonkar R,Seifert JP","","2016","13–21","10.1145/2994459.2994465","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/2994459.2994465;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2994459.2994465","Conference Paper"
"‘I Have Too Much Respect for My Elders’: Understanding South African Mobile Users' Perceptions of Privacy and Current Behaviors on Facebook and WhatsApp","Facebook usage is growing in developing countries, but we know little about how to tailor social media privacy settings to users in less well-resourced settings. To that end, we present findings from interviews of 52 current mobile social media users in South Africa. We found users' primary privacy-related concern was who else could see their posts and messages, not what data the platforms or advertisers collect about them. Second, users displayed general knowledge gaps on existing social media privacy settings and relied heavily on blocking and passwords for privacy and security protection. Third, users' privacy and security-related behaviors were heavily influenced by living in high-crime areas. Based on these findings, we suggest future work to better serve users' privacy and security needs in less well-resourced settings.","","Reichel J,Peck F,Inaba M,Moges B,Chawla BS,Chetty M","","2020","","","","Conference Paper"
"“It Cannot Do All of My Work”: Community Health Worker Perceptions of AI-Enabled Mobile Health Applications in Rural India","Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) suggest that AI applications could transform healthcare delivery in the Global South. However, as researchers and technology companies rush to develop AI applications that aid the health of marginalized communities, it is critical to consider the needs and perceptions of the community health workers (CHWs) who will have to integrate these AI applications into the essential healthcare services they provide to rural communities. We describe a qualitative study examining CHWs’ perceptions of an AI application for automated disease diagnosis. Drawing on data from 21 interviews with CHWs in rural India, we characterize (1) CHWs’ knowledge, perceptions, and understandings of AI; and (2) the benefits and challenges that CHWs anticipate as AI applications are integrated into their workflows, including their opinions on automation of their work, possible misdiagnosis and errors, data access and surveillance issues, security and privacy challenges, and questions concerning trust. We conclude by discussing the implications of our work for HCI and AI research in low-resource environments.","","Okolo CT,Kamath S,Dell N,Vashistha A","","2021","","10.1145/3411764.3445420","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3411764.3445420;http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3411764.3445420","Conference Paper"
