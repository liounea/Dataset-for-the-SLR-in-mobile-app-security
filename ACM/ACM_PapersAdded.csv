MAFIS Overlay Network: Towards a Secure Network for Mobile Automated Fingerprint Identification System over Virtual Private Network (VPN),"The Philippines is an archipelago or string of over 7,640 islands in southeastern Asia. With the community's active support, the Philippine National Police (PNP) is entrusted with upholding the law, preventing and controlling crimes, maintaining peace and order, and ensuring public safety and internal security. There are currently 1,766 police stations across the country. With the geographical challenges, criminal identification procedures take time to complete. The Mobile Automated Fingerprint Identification System (MAFIS) addresses the issues. MAFIS is currently deployed and implemented in a cloud platform that can be accessed by authorized police personnel from the web and mobile application to expedite fingerprint identification procedures. In today's world, the internet has become the de facto standard for low-cost communications architecture, as well as a significant convenience for organizations and businesses seeking to expand their operations. Because the internet is widely available in practically every region, companies frequently demand it for their local presence. As a result, a secure route within this communication network is required to ensure confidential data crossing the public network. The fast rise of digital gadgets and their Internet connectivity has resulted in security vulnerabilities to user data. Security and privacy threats have become more sophisticated day by day, increasing the demand for an updated and highly secure medium to secure entities and their valuable information on the internet. Advanced measures and high technical skills adapted by attackers, security, and privacy threats have become more sophisticated day by day, increasing the demand for an updated and highly secure medium to secure entities and their valuable information into the internet. There are other alternatives available on the market today, but the Virtual Private Network (VPN) is the most popular for establishing a secure connection over the public internet. Constructing a tunnel between the sender and receiver provides the convenience of a shared network while also providing the security of a private network. The researchers took advantage of the opportunity to create the MAFIS Overlay Network, a secure network design for MAFIS that runs over a virtual private network (VPN). Two VPN implementations were considered on the strategy: a site-to-site VPN connecting all of the law-enforcement agencies' remote offices and a remote-access VPN for the scene-of-the-crime operatives (SOCO). Speed and performance tests were performed using the industry-standard method to ensure the framework's consistency for mobile and web applications. The overall performance scores were 99 and 87 for web and mobile apps, respectively. The speed and performance test results acquired on all of the system's modules in three different criteria in terms of performance, interaction, and visual stability are significantly better than the recommended value and are thus considered highly acceptable. Overall, MAFIS has satisfactorily passed the security and compliance tests conducted and is reflected as highly satisfactory.",,"Rey, William Penaflor and Baccay, Melito A.",2022,10.1145/3538806.3538812,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3538806.3538812,"Shanghai, China",
Side-Effects of Permissions Requested by Mobile Banking on Android Platform: A Case Study of Morocco,"No one among us can deny that Android has become in the last years one of the most popular mobile operating systems worldwide, as the price of this popularity, Android becomes the favorite destination of hackers and the main target of various attacks, which takes advantage of the users' ignorance. Nowadays, Android security has become a big problem due to the free app provided and features that make it very easy for anyone to develop it. Among the applications installed under Android we found M-Banking applications that are of course infected by the security problems that surround Android applications in all the coasts and we mention here especially the permissions requested when installing an M-Banking application that had in most cases no relation with their features or services provided. In this paper, we investigated the danger of the permissions requested by mobile banking applications, their effects on sensitive user data and that their relationship with the attack called ""Man in the middle"" and its different forms and we took Morocco as a case of study.",,"Latifa, Er-rajy and Ahemed, El Kiram My and Mohamed, El Ghazouani",2017,10.1145/3108421.3108433,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3108421.3108433,"Turku, Finland",
Philippine SUCs Compliance Performance on RA 10173: A Case Study on Bukidnon State University,"The advancements in technologies have accelerated educational institutions by improving service delivery while reducing costs. As a result, it provided avenues of learning, the use of online discussions, Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs) and mobile technologies, thus making data security vulnerable. With these, it is imperative that through the lens of R.A. 10173 and NPC's five pillars that data be protected by a policy that is sustained and executed effectively. This qualitative research using case study technique aimed to evaluate, explore and explain the level of compliance of Bukidnon State University (BukSU) with RA 10173. Likewise answering the research question how does PSUCs apply and integrate R.A. 10173 with its Information Systems and Business Processes? Using single case holistic design with common rationale, and pattern matching technique in interpreting the tabulated results. It was found out that BukSU, just like most government agencies in the Philippines, is qualitatively described as Partial Compliant. Furthermore, their compliance was due to moral suasion, where BukSU, considers it as its moral obligation to protect the students and its employees' data. An initiative from PASUC, to come up with a Data Privacy Manual that will serve as a model for all PSUC's in drafting their own manual, where BukSU practices can be aligned with that of PASUC. After the September 11, 2017, deadline, BukSU invested in a UTM Unified Threat Management with a three-year license to safeguard university data resources.",,"Flores, Rozanne Tuesday G. and Ching, Michelle Renee D.",2018,10.1145/3234781.3234790,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3234781.3234790,"Hong Kong, Hong Kong",
A Report on the First Workshop on Software Engineering for Artificial Intelligence (SE4AI 2020),"With advancement in technology-driven decision making, the software-intensive systems for decisions have become more robust, dynamic, adaptive, context-aware, dependable. Architectural designs of such systems crave for new approaches where the data-driven decision making has to be incorporated in the solution. Methods for recommendation mechanism, prediction of operation failures, dealing with unsafe conditions etc are going to be part of the solution itself. Integrating such features to conceive an intelligent system that will directly influence the business solution is mostly appreciated. This would not have been possible without the direct interference of Artificial Intelligence which has been a standard procedure of industrial repertoire since 1980s. The direct impact of AI on social and economic life has been been felt mostly in last decade (since 2007) with the advent of smart phone, which contribute largely to ""big data"". The era of ""big data"" has witnessed the efficacy of Machine Learning and there is a need of the hour to combine data-driven machine intelligence with human intelligence (insights and domain knowledge) to effectively make the software development (requirement, design, testing, deployment and operation management) intelligent. The research community has shown a keen interest in this emerging field. In this report, we present a pre-organization summary of the workshop to be held on February 27, 2020, at IIIT Jabbalpur (India), co-located with the 13th Innovations in Software Engineering Conference (ISEC 2020).",,"Bandyopadhyay, Soumyadip and Mukherjee, Rohan and Sarkar, Santonu",2020,10.1145/3385032.3385055,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3385032.3385055,"Jabalpur, India",

A Literature Review on the Various Trends of Digital Forensics Usage in Combating Cybercrimes,"Different cybercrimes have been identified with instances of ransomware, online scams, Denial of Service (DoS) and many more. Wherein in the present, a variety of solutions have also emerged to be able to combat cybercrime. In the Philippines, cybercrime has increased throughout the past few years with most of them being online scams. Digital forensics focuses on locating, acquiring, processing, analyzing, and reporting on electronically stored data. Its main goal is to extract data from different devices such as computers or smartphones, process it into actionable intelligence, and can then be used in the court of law. The researchers aim to know the effectiveness of digital forensics to fight cybercrime using the different emerging trends regarding digital forensics such as cloud, social media, IoT, and network forensics. For the Philippines, having sufficient infrastructure is a possible and rational solution since globally, technology keeps evolving and so do cyber-attacks and crimes. With this, one may be able to mitigate possible attacks and damages throughout the country.",,"Blancaflor, Eric and Arpilleda, Joseph Anthony and Garcia, Adam Ulric and Monasterial, Justin Angelo and Sulit, Romeo Robert",2023,10.1145/3592307.3592328,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3592307.3592328,"Fukuoka, Japan",
Analyzing Web Application Vulnerabilities: An Empirical Study on E-Commerce Sector in Bangladesh,"Internet based application services become the essential part of peoples' daily activities. Web applications are a complex organized mess of codes; the software industry often they are built-in extreme pressure to meet a deadline. Therefore, it often retains the vulnerability holes from the development phase to the operational phase. Coding flaws, improper input sanitization, server misconfiguration, etc. causes the application vulnerable to an attacker, which may lead to service interruption and theft of valuable information. This paper conducts an empirical analysis of e-commerce based web applications to evaluate the current web application security scenario in Bangladesh. The most prominent web application security scanner named as Acunetix and Nikto were used to evaluate this study. A breakdown has conjured based on analytical results to find out the types of vulnerability. It is concluded that Cross-Site Request Forgery shows most frequent vulnerability where maximum apps were found having this vulnerability so aptly ranked as number one.

RA 10173 and Its Challenges to Philippine State Universities and Colleges' Compliance Performance: The Case of Mindanao State University - General Santos City,"Data privacy has become a major concern in the Philippines owing to the promulgation of Republic Act No. 10173, otherwise known as the Data Privacy Act of 2012, duly enforced by the National Privacy Commission (NPC). This study seeks to determine the level of compliance of Mindanao State University- General Santos City (MSU-GSC) as well as understand the challenges it encounters in accordance with the Data Privacy Act. Using a qualitative single holistic case study design and pattern matching technique, this paper was able to uncover how and why SUCs can comply with the RA 10173 and can apply such law in their information systems and academic processes. It was found out that MSU-GSC is qualitatively described as partially compliant and it further supports deterrence and legitimacy as its determinants. The moderating effect of compliance with RA 8792 or E-Commerce Act of 2000 also significantly affects its abidance with Data Privacy Act as efforts are continuously directed towards automating university processes and transactions. Moreover, three factors were identified that contributes primarily on the challenges of its compliance namely lack of better understanding, budgetary issues and time constraints. The study contributes to the literature by providing inputs about SUCs' continuing efforts toward compliance with RA 10173. It is suggested NPC to diffuse responsibility to SUCs, so as compliance with data privacy act will weigh down less. Further, it is expected a greater appreciation of the law will fuel enthusiasm to overcome challenges of compliance.",,"Doce, Lumer Jude P. and Ching, Michelle Renee D.",2018,10.1145/3234781.3234789,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3234781.3234789,"Hong Kong, Hong Kong",
Web Accessibility Assessment of Government Web Solutions: A Case Study in Digital India,"It is one of the prime intent of Government of India (GoI) to ensuremajority of government services to be delivered electronically to the citizen through the medium of web and mobile. It is therefore, besides making government services online, Digital India Programme of GoI is making concerted efforts towards improving the IT infrastructure and increasing Internet speed and penetration.Most of the websites for Information/Service delivery does not follow the best web practices. It has been observed that majority of Government websites are facing critical problems like missing identity of the website, outdated and irrelevant content and inconsistent presentation and navigation strategy. Above all, websites are also lacking sensitivity towards differently abled section of society who requires careful attention to access the government information and services. These flaws in government web sites are creating hurdle for the citizens to effectively use them.To address and resolve the above mentioned issue, the need of the hour is to build an efficient solution and mechanism. This will ensure effective delivery of information through the websites. In pursuance of the same, a set of guidelines were developed for Indian Government websites with an objective to make the Indian Government websites comply with the essential pre-requisites of UUU Trilogy i.e.; Usable, User-Centric and Universally Accessible and to establish a protocol for any website running under a Government establishment.This paper discuss about the basic issues and challenges in implementing the ""Guidelines for Indian Government Websites (GIGW)"" on few Indian Government websites of its key establishments namely NIC (National Informatics Centre) Portal (http://www.nic.in), MeitY (Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology) Portal (http://http://meity.gov.in) and Open Government Data Platform (https://data.gov.in) as well as a study conducted on National Mobile Governance Initiative (https://mgov.gov.in).

We Don't Give a Second Thought Before Providing Our Information: Understanding Users' Perceptions of Information Collection by Apps in Urban Bangladesh,"With a rapid increase in the use of digital technologies, people in the Global South including Bangladesh are exposed to a wide-range of smartphone applications (termed as apps in this paper), which offer a variety of features and services. However, privacy leakage through apps has increasingly become a major concern in Bangladesh, where the app collecting users' sensitive information without their consent was reported in news media for privacy violation. Our study with 32 participants from varying age, literacy level, and profession in Dhaka, Bangladesh unveils the perceptions of people around data collection and sharing by the app reported in privacy leakage news. All of our participants were aware of information leakage through the app they use, where they possess varying perceptions around providing personal information, like a sense of benefit, necessity and contribution, indifference, fear, or (no) authority over data collection. Our analysis reveals the relation between users' privacy perceptions, local infrastructure, and social practices in Bangladesh, where we identify the situated challenges that interfere with people's understanding of privacy notice. Our results lead to a discussion on how people's privacy perceptions are influenced by rapid urbanization and the opportunities offered by digitization in Bangladesh.

Securing Our Digital Natives: A Study of Commonly Experience Internet Safety Issues and a One-Stop Solution,"With the exponential development of electronics industry, smartphones have become a common commodity found with almost everyone irrespective of the age group providing easy access to Internet. While Internet proves to be one of the best sources for learning almost everything, an unguided exposure to it may pose serious security issues and even lead to hampering of children's growth. In our study we found that the Internet Security related problems have been on an all-time high in the past decade. It is also found that the most affected age group was 13--20 years of age and that in most cases the issues could have been avoided or at least easily resolved if the family members of the cyber victims had been more aware. In India, cybercrime and victimization in the cyber space has remained a subject of great consternation, but lacks cognizance. This paper primarily focuses on digital awareness trends amongst people of various age groups and an initiative to help make society a safer place for everyone by providing a one-stop solution to the most commonly experienced Internet Safety issues in the form of free android app ""Cyber Security Guide"".

Accelerating Public Service Delivery in India: Application of Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence in Agriculture,"The application of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in the public sector can usher performance enhancement, productivity and social equity in public service delivery mechanisms. More specifically, emerging digital technologies including Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be employed for more effective retrieval and analysis of complex, real-time data that could also be captured and shared by devices supporting Internet of Things. Literature asserts that governments worldwide must adopt solutions offered by these emerging technologies to drive innovation in public service delivery mechanisms. Appreciating these claims, this study aims to explore the current and potential use of IoT and AI. Based on the related review of literature, the study puts forth a conceptual framework for creating an open and integrated national level agriculture stack (christened as KisanOne by the authors) so that developing countries like India can effectively espouse data driven approach in its agriculture sector. ""Kisan One"" combines varied aspects of a farmers' activities including weather forecast, soil health indices, seed procurement cycle, sowing cycles, details of fertilizers availability, crop prices, etc, in a unified national stack that is accessible to all the stakeholders using application programming interfaces (APIs). Needless to say, the proposed KisanOne is a utopian implementation where existing and contemporary digital initiatives get unified on a single platform.Datasets themselves have little intrinsic value sans any ability to extract meaning from it. Intelligent data analytics could be employed on real time datasets of KisanOne both for evidence based decision making as well as for malicious intent. This paper, therefore, attempts to offer an insight into such challenges as well as suggest policy recommendations that could strengthen existing regulatory mechanisms for effective implementation of IoT and AI in existing public service delivery schemes of India. The paper is divided into four broad sections. The first section builds the Background of the paper. The next section is divided into four subsections and in this section instance of Agriculture has been detailed with reference to its current scenario and prevailing solutions. India has started using technology in Agriculture to a great extent- some of these applications such as Kisan Suvidha2 mobile app, mKisan SMS Portal, Farmer's Portal, Soil Health Card, Fertilizer Monitoring System(FMS) software, Agrimarket App have been delineated in the study. A use case on transformation of agriculture sector using IoT and AI is also presented in one of the sub-sections. A National Level Integrated Agriculture Stack is also proposed in this paper. The subsequent section presents brief picture of key challenges of implementing IoT and AI in Agriculture sector followed by recommendations and Consulive Remarks. It is an innovative and descriptive study that primarily relies on secondary data gleaned from international/national journals, reports of Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India and other online academic sources coupled with creative out-of-box thinking to propose the application of IoT and AI in varied public sectors with special emphasis on Agriculture.",,"Malhotra, Charru and Anand, Rashmi",2020,10.1145/3428502.3428510,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3428502.3428510,"Athens, Greece",
Evolution of Payments Bank and Impact From M-PESA: A Case of Mobile Banking Services in India,"A large proportion of the Indian population is excluded from basic banking services. Just one in two Indians has access to a savings bank account and just one in seven Indians has access to bank credit (Business Standard, June 28 2013). There are merely 684 million savings bank accounts in the country with a population of 1.2 billion. Branch per 100,000 adult ratio in India stands at 747 compared to 1,065 for Brazil and 2,063 for Malaysia (World Bank Financial Access Report 2010). As more people, especially the poor, gain access to financial services, they will be able to save better and get access to funding in a more structured manner. This will reduce income inequality, help the poor up the ladder, and contribute to economic development. There is a need for transactions and savings accounts for the under-served in the population. Mobile banking has been evolved in last couple of years with the help of Mobile penetration, which has shown phenomenal growth in rural areas of India. The rural subscription increased from 398.68 million at the end of December 2014 to 404.16 million at the end of January 2015, said in a statement by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India. Banks in India are already investing in mobile technology and security from last couple of years. They are adding value in services such as developing smartphone apps, mobile wallets and educating consumers about the benefits of using the mobile banking resulting in adoption of mobile banking faster among consumers as compared to internet banking.The objective of this study is:1. To understand the scope of mobile banking to reach unbanked population in India.2. To analyze the learnings of M-PESA and Payments Bank Opportunity.3.

Bridging Female Entrepreneurs Using ICT,"Among the barriers of many developing countries, one of the major problems is that a huge portion of women are still confined within the boundary of their home. A nation can in no way progress without the contribution of such a huge portion of population towards the economy. In spite of having potential, many women remain under-utilized just due to lack of necessary support, such as, capital, partners, workers, work-space and social security. In this age of technology numerous applications of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has been introduced in homes and workplaces, changing the way we live, how we work, and what we are able to do. As a part of technology revolution ICT tools are becoming increasingly accessible to the rural underprivileged people. Technology is also essential for women's economic advancement and can help women in developing countries to increase their productivity, create new entrepreneurial ventures and access new income-generating pursuits. ICT is rapidly changing the global landscape and becoming a necessary tool for running a competitive business. The range of potential benefits ICTs offer is extensive; ensure better access to information crucial to business development, market and pricing information, production technologies, compliance, forecasts and training. ICT can also enable entrepreneurs to communicate better along the value chain as well as their administration more efficient. Since information and services increasingly becoming digital in both public and private sector, entrepreneurs without using technology have an obvious disadvantage.Therefore a bridge between these two buzzwords `Entrepreneurship' and `Technology' can contribute to accelerate both the streams. Keeping pace with this motivation, we present the gender divide and ICT usage in entrepreneurship in context of Bangladesh and propose a study and platform which will help user to find complementary business partners, financers, information, services even in nearest locality. Though the problem is mainly explored focusing females in developing counties; gender based requirements of the environment, social context, customized design approaches, will be an interesting investigation. Study of this cross country topic can bridge the gender divide and its real-life implementation can surely contribute to raise the overall social and economic growth of any developing country.",,"Sharmin, Sadia",2020,10.1145/3309700.3338444,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3309700.3338444,"Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom",
Mining Entry Gates for Points of Interest,"In this paper, we propose two algorithms for identifying entry gates for Points of Interest (PoIs) using polygon representations of the PoIs (PoI polygons) and the Global Positioning System (GPS) trajectories of the Delivery Partners (DPs) obtained from their smartphones in the context of online food delivery platforms. PoIs include residential complexes, office complexes, and educational institutes where customers can order from. Identifying entry gates of PoIs helps avoid delivery hassles by routing the DPs to the nearest entry gates for customers within the PoIs. The DPs mark 'reached' on their smartphone applications when they reach the entry gate or the parking spot of the PoI. However, it is not possible to ensure compliance, and the 'reached' locations are dispersed throughout the PoI. The first algorithm is based on density-based clustering of GPS traces where the DPs mark 'reached'. The clusters that overlap with the PoI polygon as measured by a metric that we propose, namely Cluster Fraction in Polygon (CFIP), are declared as entry gate clusters. The second algorithm obtains the entry gate clusters as density-based clustering of intersections of GPS trajectories of the DPs with the PoI polygon edges. The entry gates are obtained as median centroids of the entry gate clusters for both the algorithms which are then snapped to the nearest polygon edge in the case of the first algorithm. We evaluate the algorithms for a few thousand PoIs across 9 large cities in India using appropriately defined precision and recall metrics. For single-gate PoIs, we obtain a mean precision of 84\%, a mean recall of 77\%, and an average haversine distance error of 14.7 meters for the first algorithm.

ICEGOV '07: Proceedings of the 1st International Conference on Theory and Practice of Electronic Governance,"Several years after the acceptance of Electronic Government by governments worldwide as part of their reform initiatives, there is a growing recognition that over-reliance on technology, insufficient collaboration in government, lack of emphasis on building human capacity and inadequate public consultation all limit possible benefits of such initiatives. As a result, the focus has been shifting from Electronic Government - technology-enabled improvements in government operations, to Electronic Governance - improvements in interactions between government and non-government stakeholders. Under the new focus, it is no longer acceptable to let technical or organizational issues drive these initiatives alone. Instead, a multi-disciplinary, multi-stakeholder, community-oriented approach is needed.This volume contains the papers presented at the 1st International Conference on Theory and Practice of Electronic Governance (ICEGOV2007) which took place in Macao during 10-13 December 2007. ICEGOV2007 was co-organized by the Center for Electronic Governance at United Nations University - International Institute for Software Technology (UNU-IIST-EGOV), the Center for Technology in Government, University at Albany, State University of New York, USA (CTG), and the United Nations Asian and Pacific Training Centre for Information and Communication Technology for Development (APCICT), Incheon, Republic of Korea.In a diverse international setting of networking and community-building, the conference brought together practitioners, developers and researchers from government, academia, industry and non-governmental organizations to share the latest findings in the theory and practice of Electronic Governance. The conference provided a unique opportunity for close interactions between the three categories of participants, so that each could benefit from the interaction with others. Government participants described concrete initiatives, lessons learned and the remaining challenges. In return, they learned about the latest research results, and how such results are implemented by industry and other governments to address the challenges they face. Industry and non-governmental participants demonstrated concrete technological and organizational solutions for governments. In return, they learned about the challenges faced by governments and the latest research findings available for developing solutions. Academic participants presented models, theories and frameworks which extend the understanding of Electronic Governance and upon which concrete solutions can be built. In return, they learned about the problems faced by governments, gaining access to concrete cases, and identifying opportunities to implement and deploy research prototypes.ICEGOV2007 benefited from invited talks from three well-known experts and practitioners: Sharon S. Dawes, Senior Fellow at the Center for Technology in Government, University at Albany, State University of New York, USA, and the President of the Digital Government Society of North America; Olu Agunloye, Executive Vice Chairman of the National eGovernment Strategies (NeGSt) Limited, Nigeria, and Guido Bertucci, Director of the Division for Public Administration and Development Management, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, United Nations. The speakers represented academic, government and non-governmental perspectives on Electronic Governance.In addition, a series of six tutorial-workshop events was organized on various aspects of Electronic Governance: (1) Formal Engineering Methods for Electronic Governance by Jim Davies, Oxford University, UK and Tomasz Janowski, UNU-IIST-EGOV, Macao; (2) Interoperability in Electronic Government by Marijn Janssen, TU Delft, Netherlands, and Jochen Scholl, University of Washington, USA; (3) Knowledge Management in Public Administration by Maria Wimmer, University of Koblenz, Germany, and Roland Traunm\""{u}ller, University of Linz, Austria; (4) Electronic Governance and Organizational Transformation by Theresa A. Pardo, CTG, University at Albany, SUNY, USA and Yuanfu Jiang, China National School of Administration, China; (5) Policy Development for Electronic Governance by Ik Jae Chung, University at Albany, SUNY, USA; and (6) Economics for Electronic Governance by Wojciech Cellary, Poznan University of Economics, Poland. Tutorials, held on Monday 10 December provided the audience with general foundations and basic understanding of the area, while the workshops, held on Thursday 13 December presented state-of-the-art research and applications.Regular paper sessions took place on Tuesday and Wednesday 11 and 12 December, interleaved with panel discussions. The sessions comprised presentations of the papers submitted for the conference and accepted after a thorough, three-stage review by the International Program Committee: from abstracts, through full papers, to final papers.

Teaching Accessibility in India: A Work in Progress,"There are about one billion persons with disabilities (PWDs) in the world&nbsp;[8]. Between 40 and 80 million of them are in India&nbsp;[5]. In 2015, the Government of India launched the Sugamya Bhundefinedrat Abhiyundefinedn (Accessible India Campaign), a “nation-wide Campaign for achieving universal accessibility for PWDs”. One of its three components, “Information and Communication Eco-System Accessibility”, focuses on accessible softwares and digital artifacts. The private industry is also increasingly emphasizing developing softwares that are accessible to everyone&nbsp;[See, e.g., 3, 4, 7, 1]. However, the CS curricula that ought to prepare the future professionals to develop such accessible softwares hardly cover topics related to accessibility. This project is aimed at understanding the status of accessibility education in India and developing appropriate course content. I present initial ideas, solicit feedback, and invite collaborators through the discussion on this poster. It is important to note that teaching accessibility (including accessibility topics in your courses) and teaching accessibly (making your course content accessible) are two different things; my focus is on the former. (1) Understanding the challenges to accessibility integration in CS education in India. We first need to understand the faculty’s preparedness for and attitude towards teaching accessibility topics. Shinohara et&nbsp;al. [6] report that very few CS faculty in the US teach accessibility (20\% of the respondents but only 2.5\% of all faculty surveyed). Moreover, most of them include accessibility topics in specialized human-computer interaction (HCI) courses rather than core CS courses such as Software Engineering. The numbers in India are likely to be much lower due to various factors; for instance, a cursory survey of CS faculty profiles in the twenty “Institutes of Eminence” in India revealed that only three have someone with HCI expertise. I am developing an instrument to investigate the following initial research questions: (2) Developing accessibility-themed courses and evaluating their effects. I will teach a software engineering course with a focus on Android app development in Fall 2021. I am currently developing materials for this course such that accessibility will be an underlying theme throughout the semester. I plan to include the following four topics, observed in the literature&nbsp;[2], in the course learning objectives: I will evaluate the effects of this course on how students learned certain software engineering concepts and their attitude towards accessibility.",,"Joshi, Swaroop",2021,10.1145/3446871.3469783,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3446871.3469783,"Virtual Event, USA",
Developing a Bangla Currency Recognizer for Visually Impaired People,"Deep learning based assistive technologies for the visually impaired and blind people have gained increasing attention from various research communities in recent years. In this paper, we have developed a camera-based automatic currency recognizer for Bangladeshi bank notes that assists visually impaired people in Bangladesh. We have exploited the deep learning architecture MobileNet for classification of bank notes. We have evaluated the performance of our model using a novel dataset consisting of nearly 8000 images of Bangladeshi bank notes. To verify the effectiveness and efficacy of the proposed solution, we have developed a mobile Android application, and evaluated and validated the application with the users from a blind community. The validation shows that our proposed system is robust and highly effective with heterogeneous environment.",,"Murad, Hasan and Tripto, Nafis Irtiza and Ali, Mohammad Eunus",2019,10.1145/3287098.3287152,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3287098.3287152,"Ahmedabad, India",

A Review on E-Commerce System in Bangladesh: An Empirical Study,"E-commerce is one of the most prominent service industries globally. As the world moves into software services and subscription-centric economies, e-commerce will be at the forefront of growth in emerging markets and one of such growth markets for e-commerce platforms in Bangladesh. The Bangladeshi e-commerce marketplace, while still relatively small, is seeing rapid growth and adoption thanks to the development of internet usage, smartphone penetration, and mobile payment platforms within the country. Another catalyst for the rise of e-commerce in Bangladesh is the rapid ascension of companies like Daraz and Evaly. These local e-commerce platforms have succeeded in disrupting the e-commerce market in Bangladesh by catering towards the local market and innovative business models for e-commerce in emerging markets. An interesting case study is how these company's innovative business practices, services portfolio, and marketing strategies have captured an emerging market like Bangladesh. This paper aims to contextualize global e-commerce, focusing on the Bangladeshi e-commerce market, platforms, catalysts for growth, and challenges. The research tries to look at existing business models for e-commerce platforms and identify improvements to create an e-commerce business model adaptable to emerging markets. In addition, the paper tries to outline the growing importance of subscription models for e-commerce platforms along with critical industry trends such as security, privacy, and the importance of artificial intelligence²and data analytics. The paper also showcases key business strategies for e-commerce platforms in emerging markets like Bangladesh while highlighting existing regulation challenges.",,"Islam, Ankan Shahriar and Ahmed, Sultan and Khan, Razib Hayat",2022,10.1145/3542954.3542994,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3542954.3542994,"Dhaka, Bangladesh",
Digital Intervention for Improving Medication Adherence among Patients,"Abstract Medication adherence includes the concept of patient choice, taking medication as well as compliance with follow up appointments and maintaining the suggested lifestyle modifications from a provider [1]. In this paper, I propose a system design for the Indian Healthcare System, augmented with EPIONE a mobile application that makes personalized healthcare possible and accessible to all. I inform this design through a research study on the current Indian healthcare system focusing on the complex interplay among three players in the ecosystem that are patient, physician and pharmacist and how this interplay informs and affects medication adherence among patients. As a result of the study, I identified gaps in the current system that impede patient's adherence to their medication routine. I have attempted to address the same through my proposed design intervention. Identifying these issues is a step towards embracing a personalized health culture for the future India.Access to complete project documentation is available at https://www.behance.net/gallery/129612269/Medication-Adherence",,"Aghi, Manvi",2022,10.1145/3506469.3506487,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3506469.3506487,"Virtual Event, India",
Designing Secure and Scalable End-to-End Private Network Connections between Sites via Overlay Tunnels,"Today, a secure and scalable end-to-end private network connection between head office and branches is a fundamental requirement of modern-day businesses. There are multiple solutions available, but this research will focus on the wide availability of the technology in most areas. Internet is standard network connectivity that links different branches from a different location to the business headquarter. The widespread availability of the Internet and the compatibility of the Overlay tunnels make a cost-effective solution to connect businesses. The study location is an advertising firm in the Philippines, classified as a small-to-medium-sized enterprise that requires network architecture enhancements. The critical demand is to connect three remote offices with the headquarters office for more protected file and application sharing. The remote users or employees accessing the resources anytime and anywhere should also be considered. The study will use the Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) and the Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) as overlay tunnels to implement interconnectivity between sites at remote locations.Furthermore, in light of significant security breaches, the design will consider the use of new network security measures. The new network design enables secure file and application sharing through overlay tunnels between the headquarters and the other three provincial branches and remote users. Branch connectivity uses GRE over IPSEC tunnels, dynamic routing, and only authorized VPN connections to access HQ resources. The proposed network architecture operated successfully during the test validation (using ping, tracert, and traceroute utility commands). Finally, the suggested network design is secured from MAC address flooding, ping of death (DOS), and VPN snooping based on the vulnerability studies.",,"Penaflor Rey, William and Dugang Rey, Kieth Wilhelm Jan",2022,10.1145/3531028.3531036,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3531028.3531036,"Higashi-ku, Japan",
A Quantitative Case Study on Rampant Online Ordering Scams in the Philippines,"Scams are fraudulent acts that have become more common in the Philippines as a result of the growth of Ride-Hailing, Delivery, and Food Application Service platforms. Constant loss of profit and consumer services are severely impacted; as a result, both parties are impacted by the Malicious Acts committed by these individuals in order to disrupt and hurt the users of the applications. Rampancy in Scams, particularly in certain specific places, violates the terms and conditions of the apps by committing heinous activities, but also in terms of privacy of information (e.g., Able to Access Customer Address; Access/Contact Customer Phone Number) and criminal acts in the nation.

SCC '18: Proceedings of the 6th International Workshop on Security in Cloud Computing,"It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the Sixth International Workshop on Security in Cloud Computing (SCC'18). This year's workshop continues its tradition of being the premier forum for the presentation of research results and experience reports on leading edge issues and challenges of cloud computing security. The mission of the workshop is to share novel solutions that fulfill the needs of secure and privacy-preserving cloud applications and services, and identify new directions for future research and development. SCC'18 gives researchers and practitioners a unique opportunity to share their perspectives with others interested in the topics of cloud security and privacy such as secure cloud architecture, cloud cryptography, cloud access control and key management, identification and privacy in cloud, integrity assurance for data outsourcing, integrity and verifiable computation, computation over encrypted data, and many others.The call for papers attracted 17 submissions from total 12 countries and regions, including Australia, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Norway, South Korea, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates, and United States.

Mobile Phone Usage by Low Literate Users,"We describe a qualitative study conducted using Contextual Inquiry of 60 low-literate users in India. For the purpose of this study, we define low-literate as those users whose education is equal or more than Standard Four and less than or equal to Standard Eight in the Indian State education system. Our users were recruited primarily from the contractual house-keeping staff of a very large Private Organization and an Educational Institute (42 Male, 3 Female), household help (3 Female), drivers (5 Male), guards (1 Male), shopkeepers (1 Male, 1 Female) and homemakers (4 Female). Our objective was to develop an understanding of information security issues in the context of the mobile phone, identification of problems and design ideas for design of interventions. Our methodology included Contextual Inquiry and Analysis with notes pertaining to User Statements, Task Breakdowns, Observations and Design Ideas. The notes across the study were consolidated using Affinity Diagrams.We found that users have an elementary understanding of asset valuation and response. Literacy impedes adoption of an appropriate response to the threats using the mechanisms provided by the mobile phone since conceptual models are not clearly comprehended. It is also impeded because the users are unable to articulate a structured response to the landscape of threats. Due to the cognitive load induced by the possible factors which may get involved in risk articulation, users tend to adopt mitigation techniques propagated by the micro-networks without complete comprehension of risks or due analysis. Belief systems are more likely to drive a response than a more reasoned, well-aware response. Information or awareness is propagated via social mechanisms -- however, these are not necessarily correct most of the times, primarily due to the inappropriate conceptual models formulated. The interface and conceptual model complexity of a modern touch screen smartphone compounds matters. Mobile Learning aids or Gamification of concepts can help users adopt more appropriate response mechanism to perceived threats to privacy and security issues. Interfaces built with single sign-on, local language display and text input would also help in building more safe environments for users to use the mobile phone. While more-literate users are likely to mimic a 'plan-do-check-act' model low-literate are more likely to have a 'do' or a 'do' or a 'do-act' cycle due to non-awareness or non-comprehension of 'plan-check' components.",,"Doke, Pankaj and Joshi, Anirudha",2015,10.1145/2835966.2835968,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/2835966.2835968,"Guwahati, India",
Taking E-Government to the Bottom of the Pyramid: Dial-a-Gov?,"Much attention has been paid to the use of ICTs to improve the delivery of government services to citizens in developing countries. Government and donor funds have adopted two strategies in parallel: (i) the re-engineering and automating of government services, and (ii) the installation of telecenters (community Internet access centers) for citizens to access reengineered government ""e-Gov"" services.The model of delivering e-Gov via the Internet has major drawbacks as shown by survey data representing 397 million people at the Bottom of the Pyramid (BOP) in India, Pakistan, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Thailand. First, only 49\% have even heard of the Internet and only 2.6\% have used it [15]. Second, it will take a lot more time and significant funds to roll-out enough telecenters to cover the BOP sufficiently. Third, most telecenters fail, while the successful ones are sustained by revenues from non-Internet services such as voice calls, fax and photocopying. But even these revenue streams may dwindle - according to our survey, over 40\% of current BOP non-owners plan to purchase a phone within 2 years. They will spend their already-limited communications budgets on phones they own, not at a telecenter.By viewing the telephone as the end-device for e-service delivery, implementers can automate those parts of a government process that can deliver value quickly, through ""smaller"" (less complicated, therefore less likely to fail) applications. By not seeking to re-engineer entire government departments, these projects face less resistance to change from public-sector employees. Given that over 90\% of those at the BOP use phones already [15], significant use is more likely if the necessary attention is paid to language, design and publicity.The Internet, accessed at a telecenter, and sophisticated e-Government systems will play a role in providing ""higher-end"" citizen services, for example submitting a passport application online with an uploaded digital photograph. But at a time when the Internet is barely reaching 10.3 million people at the BOP in these countries, the paper argues that phones are the cheaper, more immediate and ubiquitous tool for Asian governments to inform, transact and interact with almost 400 million of their most needy citizens.The paper presents an alternative, telephone-centric model for electronic delivery of public services citizens. It draws on research conducted by LIRNEasia in 2006 and previously published as well as unpublished e-Gov case studies.",,"Galpaya, Helani and Samarajiva, Rohan and Soysa, Shamistra",2007,10.1145/1328057.1328105,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/1328057.1328105,"Macao, China",
Facilitating Pervasive Community Policing on the Road with Mobile Roadwatch,"We consider community policing on the road with pervasive recording technologies such as dashcams and smartphones where citizens are actively volunteering to capture and report various threats to traffic safety to the police via mobile apps. This kind of novel community policing has recently gained significant popularity in Korea and India. In this work, we identify people's general attitude and concerns toward community policing on the road through an online survey. We then address the major concerns by building a mobile app that supports easy event capture/access, context tagging, and privacy preservation. Our two-week user study (n = 23) showed Roadwatch effectively supported community policing activities on the road. Further, we found that the critical factors for reporting are personal involvement and seriousness of risks, and participants were mainly motivated by their contribution to traffic safety. Finally, we discuss several practical design implications to facilitate community policing on the road.",,"Park, Sangkeun and Ilincai, Emilia-Stefania and Oh, Jeungmin and Kwon, Sujin and Mizouni, Rabeb and Lee, Uichin",2017,10.1145/3025453.3025867,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3025453.3025867,"Denver, Colorado, USA",

ASHES '17: Proceedings of the 2017 Workshop on Attacks and Solutions in Hardware Security,"It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the First Workshop on Attacks and Solutions in Hardware Security 2017 (ASHES 2017), a post-conference satellite workshop of the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security 2017 (CCS 2017) in Dallas!ASHES deals with all aspects of hardware security, and welcomes any contributions to this area. Besides being a forum for mainstream hardware security research, its mission is to specifically foster new concepts, solutions, and methodological approaches, and to promote new application scenarios, within the field. This includes, for example, new attack vectors on secure hardware, the merger of nanotechnology and hardware security, novel designs and materials, lightweight security hardware, and physical unclonable functions (PUFs) on the methodological side, as well as the internet of things, automotive security, smart homes, supply chain security, pervasive and wearable computing on the applications side. ASHES thereby aims at giving researchers and practitioners a unique opportunity to share their perspectives with others on various new and emerging aspects of hardware security.In order to account for the nature of hardware security as a rapidly developing discipline, ASHES offers four categories of submissions and papers: Full papersShort papersSystematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers, which structure or survey a certain subarea within hardware securityWild and Crazy (WaC) papers, whose aim is to distribute a promising and potentially seminal research idea at an early stage to the community.Our call for papers attracted overall 20 submissions from Australia (1), Asia (2), Canada (1), Europe (6), India (1), and the United States (9) within these four categories.Six submissions were accepted as papers to the program, amounting to an acceptance rate of exactly 30\%. Out of these six accepted papers, two originate from Europe, and four from the United States.In terms of their scientific topics, two of the six accepted papers deal with solutions in hardware security;one each falls into the above SoK- and WaC-paper categories;and two others deal with attacks on security hardware.This establishes a nice balance between the different themes and paper categories offered by the workshop.The six technical papers are complemented by three carefully chosen keynotes from leading experts in their respective areas, to which we would particularly draw the attendees' attention.In alphabetical order: Srini Devadas (MIT) will talk about ""Secure Hardware and Cryptography: Contrasts, Synergies and Challenges""Ulfar Erlingsson (Google) will deal with ""Data-driven Software Security and its Hardware Support""Ahmad-Reza Sadeghi (Darmstadt) will discuss ""Hardware-Assisted Security: Promises, Pitfalls and Opportunities""",,,2017,,,"Dallas, Texas, USA",
Telechain: Bridging Telecom Policy and Blockchain Practice,"The use of blockchain in regulatory ecosystems is a promising approach to address challenges of compliance among mutually untrusted entities. In this work, we consider applications of blockchain technologies in telecom regulations. In particular, we address growing concerns around Unsolicited Commercial Communication (UCC aka. spam) sent through text messages (SMS) and phone calls in India. Despite several regulatory measures taken to curb the menace of spam it continues to be a nuisance to subscribers while posing challenges to telecom operators and regulators alike. In this paper, we present a consortium blockchain based architecture to address the problem of UCC in India. Our solution improves subscriber experiences, improves the efficiency of regulatory processes while also positively impacting all stakeholders in the telecom ecosystem. Unlike previous approaches to the problem of UCC, which are all ex-post, our approach to adherence to the regulations is ex-ante. The proposal described in this paper is a primary contributor to the revision of regulations concerning UCC and spam by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI). The new regulations published in July 2018 were first of a kind in the world and amended the 2010 Telecom Commercial Communication Customer Preference Regulation (TCCCPR), through mandating the use of a blockchain/distributed ledgers in addressing the UCC problem. In this paper, we provide a holistic account of of the projects’ evolution from (1) its design and strategy, to (2) regulatory and policy action, (3) country wide implementation and deployment, and (4) evaluation and impact of the work. While the scope of the work presented in this paper is in the context of the UCC problem in India, we believe that the approach can be generalized to adopt blockchain based solutions to improve regulatory processes in other contexts and countries. We hope this account will serve as a useful case study for the stakeholders of the telecommunications ecosystem and regulators, and motivate countries across the world facing similar challenges to consider the viability of the technology, be convinced to establish it, continue efforts at addressing active research challenges, and scale the technology from our experiences.",,"Singanamalla, Sudheesh and Mehra, Apurv and Chandran, Nishanth and Lohchab, Himanshi and Chava, Seshanuradha and Kadayan, Asit and Bajpai, Sunil and Heimerl, Kurtis and Anderson, Richard and Lokam, Satya",2022,10.1145/3530190.3534820,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3530190.3534820,"Seattle, WA, USA",
A Fault Tolerant and Secured Network Design for File and Application Sharing in a Mid-Sized Business Environment,"This study aims to observe and improve design infrastructure of a mid-sized business focusing on the security and fault tolerant network architecture characteristics. The case site is a recruitment agency in the Philippines, categorized as a mid-sized company that needs improvement in its network design and the main requirement is to link all offices with the headquarters office for more secure file sharing and application sharing. Moreover, due to massive cyberattacks, the design will also consider the use of modern network security tools. The new network design allows secure file sharing between the headquarter office to the other five branches in the Philippines thru implementation of DNS Servers, FTP and Internal Web Server, Simplewall Firewall and NAS Setup, Cobian Backup \&amp; DMZ. Branch connectivity uses IPSEC DMVPN tunnels, dynamic routing and only permit authorized VPN connections to access HQ resources. The IPSec DMVPN allows ease and secure file sharing between branches with scalability in mind. In the test validation, the proposed network infrastructure achieved a 100\% success rate in its functionality (using ping and tracert utility) based on the simulation conducted in the ""GNS3"" platform. Finally, based on the vulnerability assessments conducted, the proposed network design has protection from MAC Address Flooding, Ping of Death (DOS) and VPN sniffing.",,"Blancaflor, Eric B. and Chua, Christian Collins C. and Parallag, Vince Anthony A. and Rey, William P. and Tamarauoyerimini, Sanami and Samonte, Mary Jane",2020,10.1145/3429523.3429528,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3429523.3429528,"Okinawa, Japan",
Jettisoning Junk Messaging in the Era of End-to-End Encryption: A Case Study of WhatsApp,"WhatsApp is a popular messaging app used by over a billion users around the globe. Due to this popularity, understanding misbehavior on WhatsApp is an important issue. The sending of unwanted junk messages by unknown contacts via WhatsApp remains understudied by researchers, in part because of the end-to-end encryption offered by the platform. We address this gap by studying junk messaging on a multilingual dataset of 2.6M messages sent to 5K public WhatsApp groups in India. We characterise both junk content and senders. We find that nearly 1 in 10 messages is unwanted content sent by junk senders, and a number of unique strategies are employed to reflect challenges faced on WhatsApp, e.g., the need to change phone numbers regularly. We finally experiment with on-device classification to automate the detection of junk, whilst respecting end-to-end encryption.",,"Agarwal, Pushkal and Raman, Aravindh and Ibosiola, Damiola and Sastry, Nishanth and Tyson, Gareth and Garimella, Kiran",2022,10.1145/3485447.3512130,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3485447.3512130,"Virtual Event, Lyon, France",
A Novel Approach to Identify Spatio-Temporal Crime Pattern in Dhaka City,"Street crime is a prevalent problem in developing countries like Bangladesh. Though this problem has been identified long before, no visible remedy or action can be seen to overcome or combat these street crimes in one of the most populated mega-cities, Dhaka, Bangladesh, of the world. In this paper, we propose a novel spatio-temporal street crime prediction model that exploits the historical street crime data of Dhaka city to predict the possibility of a crime in a particular region at a specific time. Our model captures both space and time proximity of past crimes while predicting a future crime. Experimental evaluation shows that our spatiotemporal prediction model can predict a future crime with 79.24\% sensitivity and 68.2\% specificity. As a proof of concept we develop an Android application that alerts a user about the possibility of different crimes in a place at a particular time.",,"Parvez, Md.

Society-Oriented Applications Development: Investigating Users' Values from Bangladeshi Agriculture Mobile Applications,"Limited consideration of users' values in mobile applications (apps) can lead to user disappointments and negative socio-economic consequences. Therefore, it is important to consider values in app development to avoid such adverse effects and to secure the optimum use of apps. With this aim, we conducted a case study to identify the users' desired values that are either reflected or missing in the existing Bangladeshi agriculture mobile apps. We manually analyzed 1522 reviews from 29 existing Bangladeshi agriculture apps in Google Play by following a widely used human values theory, Schwartz's theory of basic human values. Our results show that users of the selected apps have twenty one (21) desired individual values where eleven (11) values are reflected in the apps and ten (10) values are missing. This research provides a basis for the developers to design apps that consider users' values. It also provides a direction on which values they should address while developing apps. Moreover, repeating this research in different domains or societies would result in society-oriented apps that are more sensitive to users' values.",,"Shams, Rifat Ara and Hussain, Waqar and Oliver, Gillian and Nurwidyantoro, Arif and Perera, Harsha and Whittle, Jon",2020,10.1145/3377815.3381382,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3377815.3381382,"Seoul, South Korea",
MobiPot: Understanding Mobile Telephony Threats with Honeycards,"Over the past decade, the number of mobile phones has increased dramatically, overtaking the world population in October 2014. In developing countries like India and China, mobile subscribers outnumber traditional landline users and account for over 90\% of the active population. At the same time, convergence of telephony with the Internet with technologies like VoIP makes it possible to reach a large number of telephone users at a low or no cost via voice calls or SMS (short message service) messages. As a consequence, cybercriminals are abusing the telephony channel to launch attacks, e.g., scams that offer fraudulent services and voice-based phishing or vishing, that have previously relied on the Internet. In this paper, we introduce and deploy the first mobile phone honeypot called MobiPot that allow us to collect fraudulent calls and SMS messages. We implement multiple ways of advertising mobile numbers (honeycards) on MobiPot to investigate how fraudsters collect phone numbers that are targeted by them. During a period of over seven months, MobiPot collected over two thousand voice calls and SMS messages, and we confirmed that over half of them were unsolicited. We found that seeding honeycards enables us to discover attacks on the mobile phone numbers which were not known before.",,"Balduzzi, Marco and Gupta, Payas and Gu, Lion and Gao, Debin and Ahamad, Mustaque",2016,10.1145/2897845.2897890,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/2897845.2897890,"Xi'an, China",
PHYTO: An IoT Urban Gardening Mobile App,"Urban gardening has taken the interest of people in the Philippines. Due to several reasons, such as better quality of produce, less expensive alternative, and with the accessibility of the Internet, it has been made possible for people to gain the information they need for gardening and equipment. The recent advancement and dependence on the Internet today, allowed the development of Internet of things (IoT). With IoT, it is possible to connect anything to the ""cloud"" using hardware such as a microcontroller units. Application of this technology could be seen from agriculture, manufacturing, health and home security. This study focused on the integration of urban agriculture on indoor gardening. The developed system provided plant owners and enthusiasts a possible way of monitoring plants' condition in an indoor setup through a mobile application. The mobile application gives updates and information, such as light and water plant needs, through the use of microcontroller unit sensors and other components. Sensors used and connected to the indoor plants provide information like the indoor temperature and humidity, plant's soil moisture and the water level of the water source. By using a mobile application, analysis of the plant conditions can be determined and known by the plant owners through a connection with the cloud. This study shows that the developed system is highly recommended as a means of alternative urban gardening and has a high commercial viability.",,"Samonte, Mary Jane C. and Signo, Eugene Paolo E. and Gayomali, Raphael Julian M. and Rey, William P. and Serrano, Elcid A.",2019,10.1145/3322645.3322659,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3322645.3322659,"Tokyo, Japan",
Liberating Stories about a Terrorist Attack,"In recent years, there has been a digital revolution in Bangladesh. We have explored digital storytelling among families as a way of sharing personal feelings, experiences regarding a terrorist attack that took place four years ago. Many of these feelings were not shared explicitly for various social, political reasons hampering freedom of expression. The goal of the work was to ensure social justice through ways to express feelings in a trusted platform. The research explored seventeen families over fifty stories using ethnographic study methods. Storytellers were able to express themselves through family-storytelling. We have used a simple tool named Golpokotha, a mobile application that enables secured storytelling that remains private unless the user prefers to share it with other family members. Contribution of this work lies in unveiling the overall picture exploring storytelling as a medium of expression from the trauma of a national crisis from a developing country perspective. We found that most of the participants went through silence, fear, humiliations, blame game, and stigma after the crisis which resisted expressing themselves through stories. Participants chose to overcome these barriers through their sense of responsibility, optimism, and social isolation. In the long run, their inspirations and reminiscence of innocent victims’ contributions motivated them to return to their normal life before the attack. Overall, our findings suggest liberating stories, designs, and policies to combat challenging times.",,"Ahmed, Nova and Tasnim, Zareen",2023,10.1145/3572334.3572380,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3572334.3572380,"Seattle, WA, USA",

Besides being a forum for mainstream hardware security research, its mission is to specifically foster new concepts, solutions, and methodological approaches, and to promote new application scenarios. This includes, for example, new attack vectors on secure hardware, the merger of nanotechnology and hardware security, novel designs and materials, lightweight security hardware, and physical unclonable functions (PUFs) on the methodological side, as well as the internet of things, automotive security, smart homes, supply chain security, pervasive and wearable computing on the applications side. ASHES thereby aims at giving researchers and practitioners a unique opportunity to share their perspectives with others on various emerging aspects of hardware security research.In order to account for hardware security as a rapidly developing discipline, ASHES routinely offers four categories of submission: Full papers; Short papers;Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) papers, which structure or survey a certain subarea within hardware security; Wild and Crazy (WaC) papers, whose aim is to distribute a promising and potentially seminal research idea at an early stage to the community.Our call for papers this year attracted 30 submissions overall, of which 27 were conforming to submission and formatting requirements. This marks an increase of 50 percent compared to last year, where ASHES 2017 had received 20 submissions. Two submissions fell into the wild-andcrazy paper category; one into the systematization of knowledge category; the rest were regular full and short papers. Geographically, the different co-authors of submissions this year were associated with institutions in the US (18), closely followed by Europe (13), and India (1).",,,2018,,,"Toronto, Canada",
Big Data Analysis Driven Decision Making System Ensuring Energy Security of a Country,"Energy is one of the key factors for a country's economic and social growth. Bangladesh is constantly seeking sustainable energy sources for securing its increasing energy demand as energy security is a national concern. Currently, Bangladesh is producing 64\% of electricity using natural gas while 25\% is coming from petroleum and the rest from coal, renewable sources [1]. To reduce pressure from the natural gas government is trying to diversify the energy sources. To achieve sustainable diversified energy sources, the Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority (SREDA) has taken many initiatives. Energy Master Plan has been created which targets to improve Primary Energy consumption per GDP by 20\% in the year 2030. Many software applications have been developed by SREDA to monitor the progress. We propose to develop another system for energy data analysis and generate reports accordingly. Policymakers can use those reports to make strategic decisions to secure the country's energy consumption, distribution and manage the demand side. In this research work, we discussed how a big data-based solution can be developed and used to forecast the energy balance which ensures the energy security of Bangladesh. We also discuss different aspects of the proposed software system in detail including challenges and possible solutions to overcome those challenges.",,"Islam, Mahmudul and Hasan, Mahady",2021,10.1145/3477911.3477921,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3477911.3477921,"Vienna, Austria",

Predicting the Habitat for Alien Species Based on GIS,"Invasive organisms have broken the ecosystems around the world, and the economic losses are huge. It is vital to actively respond to the invasion of harmful organisms and protect the ecological environment in which we live. Predicting the habitats for alien species by using species distribution model is the most economical and effective preventive measure to prevent invasive species' occurrence and harm. By the prediction model of the biological climate similar model, namely, using the climatological data and the biological parameters of the origin of invasive species predicts global habitat so as to determine the scope of the invasion of alien species. In this study, the application Software for predicting the habitat for alien species were developed using C# (programming language) and GIS' secondary developing module---ArcGIS Engine. The experimental results have been verified, AUC value is 0.91.The case study of Pterygoplichthy spardalis, according to Pterygoplichthys pardalis'biological parameters and climatological data of the origin in South America, predicts the globally suitable areas. The research has shown that in addition to the origin of South America, North America countries such as Guatemala, Central African countries such as Gabon, Congo, the southern part of India, Thailand and Burma, Midwestern Indonesia, south Asian countries such as Malaysia and the Philippines are the high incidence area of the Pterygoplichthys pardalis' invasion.

Who is Bogus? Using One-Sided Labels to Identify Fraudulent Firms from Tax Returns,"We applya classifier to the value added tax (VAT) returns from Delhi (India) to increase tax compliance by identifying ""bogus"" (shell) firms which can be further targeted for physical inspections. We face a nonstandard applied machine learning scenario. First, onesided labels: firms that are not caught as bogus are of unknown class: bogus or legitimate, and we need to not only use them to train the classifier but also make predictions on them. Second, multiple time-periods: each firm files several periodic VAT returns but its class is fixed so prediction needs to be made at the firm, not firm-period, level. Third, point in time simulation: we estimate the revenue saving potential of our model by simulating the implementation of our system in the past. We do this by rolling back the data to the state of knowledge at a specific time and calculating the revenue impact of acting on our model's recommendations and catching the bogus firms, and estimate US$40 million in recovered revenue.",,"Mittal, Shekhar and Reich, Ofir and Mahajan, Aprajit",2018,10.1145/3209811.3209824,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3209811.3209824,"Menlo Park and San Jose, CA, USA",

Women in Rural Bangladesh: Empowered by Access to Mobile Phones,"Mobile phones are seen as a means for social and economic progress in rural and remote areas of developing countries. In Bangladesh the availability and use of information and communication technology (ICT), particularly mobile phones, is thought to have accelerated the development of women in the rural population by creating the possibility of a wider connection. Using qualitative and quantitative methods for data collection, this research has investigated the impact of mobile phone use by women with particular emphasis on opportunities in health, education and livelihood. A sample of 99 women from three rural villages in Bangladesh showed that mobile phones provide easy access to health related services. Although impact on facilitating girls' education appears to be limited, mobile phones have an indirect effect in ensuring security for girls. Respondents confirmed that their overall living standards have improved due to access to information on economic and income earning opportunities. These rural women also feel independent and empowered by access to a mobile phone. It can be argued that mobile phone technology can facilitate improvements in the living standards of rural women, which contribute to their personal development. Finally, the paper suggests that wide and innovative utilization of ICT is needed to accelerate development of women in the rural population with the help of low-cost mobile phone technology.",,"Islam, Mohd Kamrul and Slack, Frances",2016,10.1145/2910019.2910074,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/2910019.2910074,"Montevideo, Uruguay",
"Construction Worker Headcount System for Cost-Efficient Planning to Residential Buildings in Pampanga, Philippines","In the Philippines, delays and cost overruns in the construction industry could be a big problem faced by many contractors of buildings. It is also the beginning of uncertainty within the building construction process between the owner, contractor, and those involved. It is foreseen that the useful methodology to avoid construction time overruns and cost overruns is to classify their causes with the benefit of the review of related literature from journals and articles. The purpose of this thesis study is to provide the user or engineer with a distribution system for construction workers that will help them recognize all labor costs in each scope of work to accomplish the residential projects. A survey is to be circulated in the form of a questionnaire for people with experience in handling workers. These individuals include engineers, architects, and building industry professionals. A form survey can be conducted based on eight labor-related criteria. And the study of related literature was assisted by these research questions. Among thirty respondents, the form survey will be answered. The contractor, website engineer, or project manager who once worked on constructing a residential building in Pampanga would be the respondents. The survey results are interpreted, and then the researcher can provide a graphical diagram using the applied mathematics analysis method using SPSS programming code, which will make it easier for the reader to clearly define the differences between all the variables that cause time and cost overruns.

COSN '13: Proceedings of the First ACM Conference on Online Social Networks,"Welcome to the first ACM Conference on Online Social Networks - COSN! We are very excited that COSN is taking place in Boston MA, on October 7 and 8, 2013. We are proud to present its proceedings. The conference starts with a keynote by Jaron Lanier, a scientist, musician, visual artist and author of ""Who owns the Future"", followed by 22 technical paper presentations.As mentioned in the Steering Committee Chair's welcome message, COSN was formed by merging six different workshops and the submissions reflected that. We received 138 submissions from over 20 countries, roughly as many submissions as the six workshops combined! We had solicited full papers (up to 12 pages) describing original research in detail and short papers (6 pages) conveying promising work and high-level vision. We received 103 long submissions and 35 short submissions. Both the high number of submissions and especially the number of long submissions clearly show that the community needs COSN and the time is ripe for COSN. The final program includes 4 short papers and 18 long papers. The acceptance rate is 16\% (22 of 138 candidates) overall, 17.5\% (18 of 103 candidates) for long papers and 11.5\% (4 out of 35 candidates) for short papers. These rates reflect the high quality that we sought. The program reflects the broad coverage that was envisioned in merging the workshops: including papers in understanding social behavior, privacy, social graphs, trending topics, advertisements, applications, and crowdsourcing.The PC consisted of 24 members (including the two of us). In addition, we sought and received additional reviews for some papers from over 20 external reviewers. The reviewing period was just four weeks, due to the exigencies of a first time conference with specific time constraints. Five papers were filtered out for being out of scope and a small handful was rejected based on two strongly negative reviews. Each of the remaining papers received at least three reviews with several receiving 4 or 5. In all, we had over 440 reviews within four weeks---showing the diligence of the PC and external reviewers. The reviewing process included extensive on-line discussions.On July 29, we held a face-to-face day long program committee meeting at Columbia University. 50 papers with positive reviews and consensus after the on-line discussion were discussed extensively. The face to face PC meeting was beneficial as it brought various representatives of the OSN community together, some of whom were meeting others for the first time. The accepted papers cover a diversity of topics spanning the various research areas of the OSN community. The papers also reflect the globalization of the community, covering papers with author affiliations from 13 countries: Australia, Austria, Brazil, China, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and United States. Virtually all but one of the accepted papers were shepherded to ensure compliance with specific outcomes from the reviews and the discussions.",,,2013,,,"Boston, Massachusetts, USA",
E-ULAT: A Web-Based Community-Driven Application for Hyperlocal Community,"This paper seeks to know how E-ULAT, the web-based community-driven application, helps spread reliable information to a hyperlocal community alongside its usability and security. Using the System Usability Scale testing, ISO/IEC 9126 software evaluation standard, and Nessus Essentials, the researchers evaluated the system's usability and ensured the quality and security of the software. The usability and software evaluation data were collected from 50 respondents from Baliuag, Bulacan, Philippines, while the result of the security testing was analyzed from Nessus Essentials. Results showed that E-Ulat is usable, functional, reliable, efficient, maintainable, portable, and secured.

Mobile Communication for Emerging Bangladesh: Exploring the Privacy Risks for Youth Population,"Connectivity in social and economic spheres using mobile technology is a global phenomenon. This kind of communication is more significant for Southern Countries: a mean to develop, a way to come out of poverty, and a path towards an equitable society. This relationship between new communication technologies and society is complex, primarily due to their multidimensional effects in personal and social lives. Absence of a proper policy guideline and infrastructure to nurture the mobile communications' potentials can leave the users at risk of privacy violations in an increasingly flattened world. Youths of the developing societies, who have a very high representation in ICT usage hence face greater risks in terms of privacy violation and involuntary personal data commodification. This paper, as a part of a multi-year study, specifically looks into the vulnerability of Bangladeshi youth population using mobile devices, for voice and data communications. Bangladesh, one of the emerging economies in South Asia, has a thriving Telecom/ICT industry with an ever growing number of users, majority of them being young. Based on a nationwide representative survey, we have found the level of trust on existing mobile telephony to be significantly higher than the Internet across the country among all respondents, amid the absence of any clear privacy and security framework at the national level. This paper moreover shows that a significant number of the younger generation (both male and female) are unaware about the concept of privacy in the 'Digital Age' and also have little or no idea about possible risks involved with sharing any voice or data communication.",,"Hussain, Faheem and Ullah, Mohammad Sahid",2012,10.1145/2346536.2346577,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/2346536.2346577,"Singapore, Singapore",

NOTERE '08: Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on New Technologies in Distributed Systems,"This volume contains papers selected for presentation at the 8th International Conference on New Technologies in Distributed Systems (NOTERE 2008) which took place in Lyon, France on June 23- 27, 2008.Systems have been evolving from pre-defined, monolithic, centralized architectures to increasingly decentralized, distributed, and dynamically composed federations of components. New applications, such as global supply-chain management and complex health-care systems, impose major research challenges in integration, interoperability, discovery, negotiation, collaboration, and optimization. Distributed and mobile collaboration technologies are beginning to allow people to move across organizational boundaries and to interact within and across organizations as well as communities, creating virtual communities or so-called ""social networks"". These virtual systems require sophisticated collaboration functionalities. Service-oriented architectures are emerging as a possible solution to build smart networks and enable grid and on-demand computing. The fast evolution of wireless technologies drives demand to extend interaction between users and mobile devices to the interaction with objects and services in the everyday world, opening thus the opportunity for context-aware and ubiquitous computing. Wireless Internet, mobile ad-hoc and sensor networks are seen as new platforms for future distributed and pervasive systems, exacerbating in turn the problems of privacy and security. Software processes are evolving from pre-specified sequential work-flows to decentralized and multi-organization collaborative endeavors. Business environments demand increased flexibility, dependability, fault-tolerance, and autonomy of involved heterogeneous systems. While significant progress has been achieved in distributed systems, new and adaptive technologies are needed to meet the fast evolving requirements and challenges presented by a myriad of new applications.The International Conference on New Technologies in Distributed Systems (NOTERE) is a bilingual (French/English) forum intended to bring together researchers and practitioners who are actively engaged both in theoretical and practical aspects of New Technologies in distributed systems. The main objective is to provide an effective forum for exchanging up-to-date information and experiences in distributed systems and debating issues and directions for further research and development.NOTERE 2008 received 97 submissions from all over the world including Algeria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Morocco, Spain, Tunisia, and USA. After a thorough review process for each submission by the Program Committee members and expert reviewers recommended by PC members, NOTERE 2008 chairs accepted 31 full research papers and 3 short research papers resulting in an acceptance rate of 36\%. This volume also includes NOTERE 2008 DEMO papers.The NOTERE 2008 conference was supported by Lyon 1 University, INSA of Lyon, Lyon 2 University, IUT A of Lyon, ISTASE Institute in Saint-Etienne, LIRIS Laboratory, the French ministry of high education and research, France Telecom R\&amp;D, MAIF, the local ""Conseil Regional du Rh\^{o}ne"", the local ""Conseil G\'{e}neral du Rh\^{o}ne"", and the city of Villeurbanne.",,,2008,,,"Lyon, France",
Face Recognition (FR) Integration on MABIS: A Mobile Automated Biometric Identification System for Law Enforcement in the Philippines,"The Philippines is a southeastern Asian archipelago of over 7,640 islands. The Philippine National Police (PNP) is tasked with upholding the law, preventing and controlling crime, maintaining peace and order, and ensuring public safety and internal security with the active support of the community. Currently, the country has 1,766 police stations. Criminal identification procedures take time to complete due to geographical challenges. To address such challenges, the Mobile Automated Fingerprint Identification System (MAFIS) was developed. The integration of face recognition with the existing MAFIS makes it MABIS, a Mobile Automated Biometric Identification System. The MABIS allows law enforcers to use both fingerprint and face recognition to identify law offenders by searching the criminal database for existing records. If found, criminal records will be retrieved for investigation and referenced. If no information is found, a new record will be added. The goal of the paper is to integrate a Face Recognition (FR) system into an existing MAFIS by employing an open-source facial recognition service.",,"Rey, William Penaflor",2023,10.1145/3592307.3592309,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3592307.3592309,"Fukuoka, Japan",
Examining the Use and Non-Use of Mobile Payment Systems for Merchant Payments in India,"Many countries across the globe are engaged in efforts to promote a cashless society. In India, there is a strong top-down push by the government and the private sector for mobile payments. In this work, we examine the benefits and pitfalls people perceive in using mobile payments for customer-merchant transactions. Through interviews with 19 customers and 15 merchants across rural, periurban, and urban India, we explore people's awareness about mobile payment systems, perceived trade-offs among different payment methods, and the security, privacy, and utility barriers in its adoption and use. Overall, we found that customers were interested in adopting mobile payments for referral rewards and sign-up incentives, but were hesitant to regularly use them, whereas merchants saw mobile payments as an unnecessary burden for their business. We discuss the nuanced views of customers and merchants, and offer recommendations to address the barriers in the use of mobile payments for customer-to-merchant transactions.",,"Vashistha, Aditya and Anderson, Richard and Mare, Shrirang",2019,10.1145/3314344.3332499,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3314344.3332499,"Accra, Ghana",
Fear and the City: Role of Mobile Services in Harnessing Safety and Security in Urban Use Contexts,"This paper describes investigation of a mobile communication system that helps alleviate fear experienced in the urban context. In order to obtain empirically grounded insights for the concept design, urban females in their twenties and thirties and living in Bangalore, New Delhi and San Francisco, were studied. More than 200 females filled in an online survey. Extensive qualitative data for 13 participants were collected through week long diaries, semi-structured interviews, and situated participative enactment of scenarios. Fear-related concerns were voiced both in India and the U.S., suggesting that reducing fear, particularly in a pedestrian context after the onset of darkness, could be a globally applicable need. User research findings into subjective experiences of fear, contexts in which they occur, and behavioral strategies were used to design a mobile service titled ComfortZones. This concept was developed to the level of a high fidelity prototype and tested in a field trial in India. The investigation highlights further opportunities for design, particularly the notion of emphasizing positive and socially successful qualities of cities to communities concerned with their safety and security.",,"Blom, Jan and Viswanathan, Divya and Spasojevic, Mirjana and Go, Janet and Acharya, Karthik and Ahonius, Robert",2010,10.1145/1753326.1753602,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/1753326.1753602,"Atlanta, Georgia, USA",

ERheumatologist: Mobile-Based Expert System for Rheumatology Utilizing Fuzzy Logic Algorithm,"Rheumatic or musculoskeletal conditions comprise over 150 diseases and syndromes, which are usually progressive and associated with pain. They can broadly be categorized as joint diseases, physical disability, spinal disorders, and conditions resulting from trauma. Musculoskeletal conditions are leading causes of morbidity and disability, giving rise to enormous healthcare expenditures and loss of work. [1]The annual mortality rate per 100,000 people from rheumatoid arthritis in Philippines has increased by 17.6\% since 1990, an average of 0.8\% a year.[2]Likewise, we developed a mobile-based expert system focusing on rheumatic disease which allows users to diagnose their current rheumatic condition. It allows user to identify the possible cause of their joints and muscle pain. It will benefit the user since the system will enhance their knowledge of rheumatic diseases aside from the basic information they have The system applies the concept of Fuzzy Logic Algorithm to be able to get the possible result of diagnostic testing. This algorithm will allow the system to determine and categorize possible symptoms and evaluated by the different rules as part of the inference engine and validated by the knowledge-based database. The system also includes additional feature in providing information of different rheumatic disease and possible remedies. The system was evaluated by different users such as Rheumatologist, mobile developer and possible user of different ages to ensure that the system achieve its goals and objectives. As a result of the evaluation, users agreed that the application performed its functions as a diagnostic tool, can provide a good interface for ease of access and able to provide a clear and concise information.",,"Corpuz, Mark Jade S. and Avestro, Junnel and Calanda, Fredilyn B. and Morco, Roselia C. and Angeles, Jean M. and Alcala, Carl Matthew S.",2017,10.1145/3168390.3168428,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3168390.3168428,"Jakarta, Indonesia",
EMSOFT '04: Proceedings of the 4th ACM International Conference on Embedded Software,"This volume contains the papers presented at the Fourth ACM International Conference on Embedded Software (EMSOFT 2004), held in Pisa, Italy, on September 27-29, 2004. The purpose of the conference is to bring together researchers and developers from academia, industry, and government to advance the science, engineering, and technology in embedded software development. EMSOFT was started in 2001 with focus on principles of embedded software development and aims at covering all aspects of embedded software.The typical subjects treated in the conference are traditionally related to system design and integration methodologies, programming languages and software engineering, hardware/software co-design and systems-on-chip, operating systems and scheduling, hardware/software interfaces, models of computation, formal methods, compilers, execution time analysis, and networked embedded systems. During the last few years, the field of embedded systems quickly expanded towards new application areas, including multimedia computing, wireless networks and mobile distributed systems. Such new domains gave rise to new challenges and stimulated research in novel directions, such as quality of service management, energy-aware computing, stochastic scheduling, and feedback-based techniques for adaptive operating systems. The papers contained in this volume reflect such a trend and describe the work of leading research groups from all over the world. This year's conference attracted 87 submissions from 15 different countries, including the United States, South American, and Asian countries, showing a net increased interest in this conference from the international community. Among the submissions, 31 papers have been selected for publication and appear in this volume.In addition to the main technical sessions, this year we have organized the following special events: the First International Workshop on Power-Aware Real-Time Computing (PARC 2004), chaired by Daniel Moss\'{e} (University of Pittsburgh, USA) and Luca Benini (University of Bologna, Italy), and the First International Workshop on Probabilistic Analysis Techniques for Real-Time and Embedded Systems (PARTES 2004), chaired by Guillem Bernat (University of York, UK) and Alessandro Bogliolo (University of Urbino, Italy).The program also includes five keynote addresses, given by Richard Newton (University of California at Berkeley, USA), Hideyuki Tokuda (Keio University, Japan), Krithi Ramamritham (IIT Bombay, India), Nevin Heintze (Agere Systems USA), and Alan Kay (HP, USA).",,,2004,,,"Pisa, Italy",
HT '07: Proceedings of the Eighteenth Conference on Hypertext and Hypermedia,"It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 18th International ACM Conference on Hypertext and Hypermedia 'Hypertext, The Web, and Beyond: Five Autonomous Programmes, One Unified Conference'. The conference takes place in the Manchester Museum in Manchester, UK. The museum is located within the University of Manchester campus in the centre of Manchester. The city also has a rich scientific and academic heritage, with The University of Manchester being the home to twenty Nobel Prize winners and of such academic achievements as the world's first stored programmable computer, the splitting of the atom and the world's largest steerable radio telescope.This year we had a major increase in submissions on 2006, over both full technical papers, and posters and demonstrations. With submissions coming from over thirty countries across four continents from Belgium to Brazil, Italy to India, and South Korea to Sweden. With an acceptance rate of 35\% the quality of the conference is maintained but with submissions such as 'Towards Better Understanding of Folksonomic Patterns', 'Revealing the Hidden Ethnography of User Browsing Behavior', and 'Assembly Lines: Web Generators as Hypertexts' our submission topics are significantly broadening.These changes are also echoed in our Keynote, After Dinner Keynote, and Closing Plenary. Our Keynote is Professor Carole Goble, Director of the myGrid project (the largest UK e-Science pilot project), producer of the widely-used Taverna open source application (now part of the Open Middleware Infrastructure Institute). She is also the co-director of the e-Science North West regional centre. Our after dinner Keynote is Professor Wendy Hall, Head of School at the University of Southampton's School of Electronics and Computer Science. She is the founding Head of the Intelligence, Agents, Multimedia (IAM) research group and has published over 350 academic papers. In 2003 Wendy was appointed President of the British Computer Society (BCS) and is one of the few females to hold a fellowship of the Royal Academy of Engineering as well as being made a Commander of The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE), awarded in 2000. Finally, we all know our Closing Plenary speaker Theodor Holm Nelson, credited with first use of the words hypermedia, transclusion, founder of Project Xanadu; here we also see his new work on CosmicBook, and understand his ideas for the future.ACM Hypertext, as a conference series, has always maintained very high quality standards, combined with a fairly strict adherence to the research topic of Hypertext and Hypermedia. Not giving in to the ""hypertext and the Web are just the same"" hype has allowed the conference to maintain its high profile, albeit at the expense of submission and attendance numbers. Not wishing to compromise on quality ACM Hypertext has taken a turn for broadening its scope. This has resulted in the five ""autonomous programmes"" of ACM Hypertext 2007.Hypertext is everywhere, in theory research, in very practical applications, in society, in personal interfaces and in culture and communication. Separate program committees evaluated submissions in each of these tracks, resulting in a selection of high quality full and short papers that offer the conference attendees a varied but in depth view of current hypertext research.Throughout the history of the ACM Hypertext Conference, researchers have tried to capture what hypertext really is. The Hypertext Models and Theory programme specifically targets this ""hard core"" formal study of structural, sculptural, spatial, open, dynamic and adaptive or any other type of hypertext (or Web-based Information System). The Models and Theory track has indeed attracted some visionary submissions that shape the future of WIS and hypertext systems and thus will become standard reference material in the future.Hypertext is alive and in use in various applications. The Practical Hypertext programme looked at collecting some of these applications of hypertext including The Web, Semantic Web, Web Engineering, and Web Design. These topics concern themselves with all aspects of making valuable everyday hypertext applications, not exclusively on the Web. As a result, the track has gathered a variety of papers which illustrate classical issues in practical hypertext, such as reverse linking, interesting hyperspace applications such as hyperspeech, user-assisted similarity estimation on the web, and lessons learnt from industrial semantic web applications and learning style applications.The inclusion of ""Social Hypertext"" this year as an explicit theme of the conference reflects the fact that this area has reached maturity. What is Social Hypertext? We might define it as Hypertext that gets better the more people use it - but Tim Berners-Lee would be the first to point out that this is exactly what the Web is. This year we made a specific effort to recruit committee members and reviewers from emerging research communities involved in technologies such as wikis and blogging and we circulated the Call for Papers within these communities. The predominant research issue that was most evident in the excellent set of papers we reviewed was that of analysis of the patterns of use of social software sites, but the area continues to evolve, and the committee's selection of papers reflects the width of the area. We hope to see this theme expand further in the future.The focus of Hypertext and the Person is on a human centered Web, with an eye towards enabling all users, including those with disabilities to benefit from hypertext and hypermedia. Usability and accessibility are stressed, with a diverse set of issues explored. Papers in this track address hypertext navigation, adaptations for individual needs, educational applications, and collaborative hypermedia.When the first ACM Hypertext Workshop convened twenty years ago, most researchers believed that the chief obstacles to widespread use of hypertext were technical and economic. Could systems perform sufficiently quickly? Could link integrity be achieved? Could society conceivably afford the cost of a digital library? At the same time, we assumed that, once the systems were designed and built, actually writing hypertexts would be a straightforward task.Today, the most daunting engineering challenges have been met, although new challenges always arise. However, the craft of hypertext writing poses many unexpected challenges. The study of hypertext fiction is a staple of university curricula throughout the world, but it is clear that we are only beginning to understand the theory of hypertext rhetoric and the practice of hypertext criticism. From the details of semantic metadata to the grand vistas of the curation of digital artifacts, and from the workaday world of microformats and weblog networks to the abstract realms of metafiction, sculptural, and feral hypertext, hypertext's impact on culture is as undeniable as it is, still, incompletely understood.",,,2007,,,"Manchester, UK",
Wireless Network Enabled Rice Black Bug Traps with Meteorological Wind Sensory System and Intelligent Trap Distance Detection Using IoT Technology,"Rice black bug is one of the most difficult pest to manage. Massive infestations of the rice black bugs were recorded across the world including the Philippines, devastating thousands of hectares of rice field and agricultural lands. In a local communal rice field in the Philippines, farmers are using light trap in adjacent rice fields to control infestation as alternative to pesticides. According to the farmers, having multiple traps in the rice field can help in having better rice black bug catch index. Researches suggests that multiple light traps should have proper distance from each other to avoid light interference for proper bug attraction. However, it is known in the studies that increases in light-trap catches have also been shown to be associated with changes in wind direction especially for weak flier insects including Rice Black BugThis study aims to develop a system with two (2) wirelessly networked portable light traps that can be deployed in a vast rice field area. Light traps communicate with each other by identifying the proper distance, and constantly checks the wind direction that will allow farmers to relocate the traps in the rice field for better catch. A mobile application was developed to monitor distance, wind direction, and black bug catch that notifies farmers of suggestions to properly locate or place the light trap in the rice field. Actual tests were performed in a communal rice field during on-set and off-set of full moon cycle. Results show better patterns of rice black bug catch when traps were place in proper distance and facing the right wind direction.",,"Martillano, Dennis A. and Alforja, Berlin M. and Benjamin, Tristien Kennedy S. and De Ramos, Juan Miguel E. and Wong, Antonio Jan M.",2020,10.1145/3380678.3380683,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3380678.3380683,"Prague, Czech Republic",

An Overview of Neuromarketing Research in Developing Countries: Prospects and Challenges,"Neuromarketing has opened a new door in marketing research understanding behavioral economics with the help of Neuroscience. Over the past decade, Neuroscientists, Psychiatrists, Engineers, and Market-researchers have conducted several groundbreaking studies aiming to understand consumers’ motivations, preferences, and decisions. However, these studies and practices are mainly based on developed countries. In this study, we outline the opportunities, real-life applications, future scenarios and shed light on the challenges faced by the researchers, marketers, and policymakers in developing countries including Bangladesh. Moreover, we have focused on the significant brain lobe involving neuromarketing research with the explanation of current technologies used in this area. We have concluded with some feasible recommendations to continue and sustain the growth of the neuromarketing field in developing countries.

Poking a Hole in the Wall: Efficient Censorship-Resistant Internet Communications by Parasitizing on WebRTC,"Many censorship circumvention tools rely on trusted proxies that allow users within censored regions to access blocked Internet content by tunneling it through a covert channel (e.g,. piggybacking on Skype video calls). However, building tools that can simultaneously (i) provide good bandwidth capacity for accommodating the typical activities of Internet users, and (ii) be secure against traffic analysis attacks has remained an open problem and a stumbling block to the practical adoption of such tools for censorship evasion.We present Protozoa, a censorship-resistant tunneling tool featuring both high-performing covert channels and strong traffic analysis resistance. To create a covert channel, a user only needs to make a video call with a trusted party located outside the censored region using a popular WebRTC streaming service, e.g., Whereby. Protozoa can then covertly tunnel all IP traffic from unmodified user applications (e.g., Firefox) through the WebRTC video stream.This is achieved by hooking into the WebRTC stack and replacing the encoded video frame data with IP packet payload, while ensuring that the payload of the WebRTC stream remains encrypted, and the stream's statistical properties remain in all identical to those of any common video call. This technique allows for sustaining enough throughput to enable common-use Internet applications, e.g., web browsing or bulk data transfer, and avoid detection by state-of-the-art traffic analysis attacks. We show that Protozoa is able to evade state-level censorship in China, Russia, and India.",,"Barradas, Diogo and Santos, Nuno and Rodrigues, Lu\'{\i}s and Nunes, V\'{\i}tor",2020,10.1145/3372297.3417874,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3372297.3417874,"Virtual Event, USA",

"Digital Contact Tracing: Technologies, Shortcomings, and the Path Forward","Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, technology enthusiasts have pushed for digital contact tracing as a critical tool for breaking the COVID-19 transmission chains. Motivated by this push, many countries and companies have created apps that enable digital contact tracing with the goal to identify the chain of transmission from an infected individual to others and enable early quarantine. Digital contact tracing applications like AarogyaSetu in India, TraceTogether in Singapore, SwissCovid in Switzerland, and others have been downloaded hundreds of millions of times. Yet, this technology hasn't seen the impact that we envisioned at the start of the pandemic. Some countries have rolled back their apps, while others have seen low adoption [12, 17].Therefore, it is prudent to ask what the technology landscape of contact-tracing looks like and what are the missing pieces. We attempt to undertake this task in this paper. We present a high-level review of technologies underlying digital contact tracing, a set of metrics that are important while evaluating different contact tracing technologies, and evaluate where the different technologies stand today on this set of metrics. Our hope is two fold: (a) Future designers of contact tracing applications can use this review paper to understand the technology landscape, and (b) Researchers can identify and solve the missing pieces of this puzzle, so that we are ready to face the rest of the COVID-19 pandemic and any future pandemics. A majority of this discussion is focused on the ability to identify contact between individuals. The questions of ethics, privacy, and security of such contact tracing are briefly mentioned but not discussed in detail.",,"Trivedi, Amee and Vasisht, Deepak",2020,10.1145/3431832.3431841,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3431832.3431841,,
Automated Generation of Counterterrorism Policies Using Multiexpert Input,"The use of game theory to model conflict has been studied by several researchers, spearheaded by Schelling. Most of these efforts assume a single payoff matrix that captures players’ utilities under different assumptions about what the players will do. Our experience in counterterrorism applications is that experts disagree on these payoffs. We leverage Shapley’s&nbsp;notion of vector equilibria, which formulates games where there are multiple payoff matrices, but note that they are very hard to compute in practice. To effectively enumerate large numbers of equilibria with payoffs provided by multiple experts, we propose a novel combination of vector payoffs and well-supported ϵ-approximate equilibria. We develop bounds related to computation of these equilibria for some special cases and give a quasipolynomial time approximation scheme (QPTAS) for the general case when the number of players is small (which is true in many real-world applications). Leveraging this QPTAS, we give efficient algorithms to find such equilibria and experimental results showing that they work well on simulated data.We then built a policy recommendation engine based on vector equilibria, called PREVE. We use PREVE to model the terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), responsible for the 2008 Mumbai attacks, as a five-player game. Specifically, we apply it to three payoff matrices provided by experts in India--Pakistan relations, analyze the equilibria generated by PREVE, and suggest counterterrorism policies that may reduce attacks by LeT. We briefly discuss these results and identify their strengths and weaknesses from a policy point of view.",,"Sawant, Anshul and Dickerson, John P. and Hajiaghayi, Mohammad T. and Subrahmanian, V.

A Framework to Leverage Cloud for Modernization of Indian Agricultural Produce Marketing System,"In India, Information and Communication technology (ICT) is being leveraged as a modernization tool in almost every sector of economy such as health, education, and transportation. But when we consider the agricultural scenario in the Indian context, we realise that the ICT remains to be exploited to accrue its invaluable benefits. In recent times, the Government of India has introduced several initiatives to promote the application of ICT in agriculture sector. But when we compare the scale of ICT application in Indian agriculture sector with other developing countries like China, Brazil, etc., we find that application of ICT in Indian agriculture is yet to be applied on a significant magnitude. In this paper, we propose a cloud deployment model ""Agri-Bridge"", which provides access to agricultural market related information to farmers facing market connectivity constraints and acute capital shortage. Also, this model will operate as a bridge between the farmers and consumers within the existing agricultural produce marketing chain. This model utilizes the existing Government services, Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) databases, retail market sources besides leveraging cloud computing, mobile phone services and Internet services to provide a solution to the problem of lack of access to real-time market information to the farmers, hence modernising the Indian agricultural produce marketing system.",,"Matharu, Gurpreet Singh and Mishra, Anju and Chhikara, Pallavi",2014,10.1145/2677855.2677862,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/2677855.2677862,"Udaipur, Rajasthan, India",
Terratech: A Crowdsourcing Web Application That Aids Environmental Needs and Concerns,"Environmental problems in the Philippines are increasing each day to the point that it endanger the lives of its citizens due to lack of awareness and information on how to address these concerns, as part of mitigating this problem, we developed a responsive web application known as TerraTech that allows users to immediately report environmental concerns in their area through the means of microtask crowdsourcing where the system would gather reports from users by means of using the approach of geocoding, reverse geocoding, and information visualization in which the end result would be used to deploy volunteers to the area of the reported concern and each reported data is converted into a visualized form for data analysis, the completed reports can be posted on Twitter to raise environmental awareness not only to the real world, but also through social media as a means of advertising the system for potential users. Furthermore, using the developed interactive map, TerraTech integrates and visualizes information per report through plotting and viewing the intensity of the number of reports per area. TerraTech is already creating a positive impact in addressing environmental concerns, it is not only improving the surroundings, but also saves the lives of the people for potential environmental disasters.",,"Intal, Grace Lorraine and Garcia, Edward and Bendita, John Benjet",2022,10.1145/3535782.3535832,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3535782.3535832,"Chiang Mai, Thailand",
Economic and Operational Impact Analysis of a Mobile Automated Fingerprint Identification System (MAFIS) for the Philippine National Police,"The Philippines, an archipelago consisting of 7,640 islands, is located in Southeast Asia. The Philippine National Police (PNP) is the civilian national police force of the country. Currently, there are 1,766 Police Stations established nationwide. The PNP comprises 90 Component City Police stations and 1,507 Municipal Police stations under the Police Provincial Offices. There are 131 Police Stations under the City Police Offices and 38 City Police Stations in the National Capital Regional Police Office, which serves as the primary operating arms of the PNP for the anti-criminality campaign. The PNP faces challenges on criminal identification processes turnaround time. All fingerprints recovered from the crime scenes needed to be forwarded to the national headquarter for identification and resolution. The development of the Mobile Automated Fingerprint Identification System (MAFIS) can address such challenges. The researchers used this occasion to conduct a feasibility assessment on the proposed Mobile Automated Fingerprint Identification System's economic and operational aspects. The economic feasibility study results revealed that the MAFIS, in conjunction with the mobile automated fingerprint identification system, has a good chance of becoming a long-term way of addressing fingerprint identification in the country. After five years, the system has a 43.1 percent ROI (return on investment), a 22.2 percent IRR (internal rate of return), and payback after year 5. Based on the speed and performance tests results, MAFIS has achieved a performance speed of 0.8s faster than the optimal value of 2.5s, according to PageSpeed Insights. MAFIS has a measured value of 10ms quicker than 100ms, according to the PSI test findings. The reliability and availability results reveal that the created system was highly acceptable, with an overall mean of 4.61 and a standard deviation of 0.78, indicating that most responses were near the average. MAFIS was rated as efficient and highly acceptable in the evaluation, with an overall mean of 4.85. The test also revealed that MAFIS' overall usability is outstanding, with a weighted mean of 1.47. The capacity and scalability have a weighted mean of 4.90, with a deviation of 0.30, which means highly acceptable. The maintainability evaluation findings also showed that MAFIS is very satisfactory, with an overall mean of 4.82. The system's security test revealed that MAFIS passed the TLS and SSL with a B grade from Qualys SSL Labs. It also received an A+ overall degree based on CryptCheck's rating standards. The MAFIS has proven to be both fiscally and operationally viable.",,"Penaflor Rey, William and V.

Automating Care: Online Food Delivery Work During the CoVID-19 Crisis in India,"On March 23, 2020, the Government of India (GoI) announced one of the strictest nationwide lockdowns in the world to curb the spread of novel SARS-CoV-2, otherwise known as CoVID-19. The country came to a standstill overnight and the service industry, including small businesses and restaurants, took a massive financial hit. The unknown nature of the virus and its spread deepened anxiety among the general public, quickly turning to distrust towards any “outside” contact with goods and people. In the hopes of (re)building consumer trust, food delivery platforms Zomato and Swiggy began providing digital solutions to exhibit care towards their customers, including: (1) sharing delivery workers’ live temperatures alongside the workers’ profile inside the app; (2) mandating the use of the controversial contact tracing app Aarogya Setu for the workers; (3) monitoring workers’ usage of masks through random selfie requests; and (4) sharing specific worker vaccination details on the app for customers to view, including vaccination date and the vaccine’s serial number. Such invasive data gathering infrastructures to address public health threats have long focused on the surveillance of laborers, migrants, and the bodies of other marginalized communities. Framed as public health management, such biometric and health data gathering is treated as a necessary feature of caring for the well-being of the general public. However, such datafication practices - ones which primarily focus on the extraction of data from one specific community in order to mollify the concerns of another - normalizes the false perception that disease is transmitted unidirectionally: from worker to the consumer. By centering food delivery workers’ experiences during the pandemic and examining the normalization of such surveillance in the name of care and recovery, this paper aims to examine how new regimes of care are manufactured and legitimized using harmful and unethical datafication practices.",,"Singh, Anubha and Park, Tina",2022,10.1145/3531146.3533082,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3531146.3533082,"Seoul, Republic of Korea",
A Hindi Speech Recognizer for an Agricultural Video Search Application,"Voice user interfaces for ICTD applications have immense potential in their ability to reach to a large illiterate or semi-literate population in these regions where text-based interfaces are of little use. However, building speech systems for a new language is a highly resource intensive task. There have been attempts in the past to develop techniques to circumvent the need for large amounts of data and technical expertise required to build such systems. In this paper we present the development and evaluation of an application specific speech recognizer for Hindi. We use the Salaam method [4] to bootstrap a high quality speech engine in English to develop a mobile speech based agricultural video search for farmers in India.

The TPC also had broad industry participation, with members from Cisco, Google, IBM, Microsoft, and NEC.The paper review process was double-blind. It was carried out in three phases: First, each paper was reviewed by at least three TPC members, and the top 107 papers were advanced to the second phase. Review scores, in addition to reviewer confidence and normalization with respect to other papers by the same reviewer, were considered in the selection process. In the second phase, each paper was reviewed by at least two more reviewers, followed by an online discussion; that produced 68 papers for the TPC meeting on June 1 and 2 in Seattle, which was the final phase. These 68 papers were discussed at length at the meeting. Eventually, 35 papers were conditionally accepted into the program. The heavy PC participated in all three phases; the light TPC participated only in the first phase.Each of the 35 papers was assigned a shepherd from the heavy PC. Shepherds' identities were provided to authors, unlike in the previous year. Reviewers remained anonymous. Shepherds coordinated with reviewers to address the review comments and they approved the final versions for publication.

Nutrient Management Decision Support System for Livelihood Security of Farmers,"Submissions of demonstrations for DEV 2013Poor Soil health is leading to reduction in farm yield to farmers due to nutrient mining and imbalanced application of fertilisers and growth promoters. Generalized approach and change in associated knowledge systems leads to nutrient application, while ignoring individual farm diversity, uniqueness and management history, hence lower crop yield. Site-specific nutrient management (SSNM) practices not only help in maintaining the soil productivity and hence better crop, the mobile phone based Soil+ service helps the farmers receive information about nutrient management at timed intervals through personal cell phones as per the crop cycle and variety, hence helping increased farm yield.As part of building its services portfolio in agriculture ekgaon undertook a project ""Nutrient Management Decision Support System for Livelihood Security of Farmers"" in October 2009 with the aim of providing a reliable and customised last mile, site-specific information on managing soil nutrients to farmers individually in realtime. The service offered 'Soil+', is provided on mobile phone of the farmer through an automated system in local language in text and/or voice modes as per exercised choice. The system includes a centralized server running the application with standardized algorithm for each crop, based on nutrient removed from the soil by previous crop \&amp; targeted yield for the new crop, customised based on the farmers data collected earlier.The Soil+ service is now part of a portfolio of services branded as 'OneFarm', the service helps the farmers receive information about nutrient management at timed intervals through personal cell phones as per the crop cycle and variety. The system includes a centralized server running a application (for system architecture please see the figure) with standardized algorithm for each crop, based on nutrient removed from the soil by previous crop \&amp; targeted yield for the crop to be cultivated, customised based on the farmers data collected earlier.The process involved to access the service has been made simple, using interactive voice response to capture the uniqueness of each farm, based on that server provides the best possible unique nutrient management solution for that farm by processing the unique information received from that farm in realtime.This system takes the advantage of the availability of cell phones in the village and among farmers for last mile delivery of information services. Farmer could also access a more detailed advisory through the website by visiting any community information centre also in local language. A set of call-menu are also available for ""anytime"" information access by farmer through IVRS, provided in a small handbook.The project was implemented in Tamilnadu, India with farmers groups constituting 500 farmers (including 10 women farmers). The initial impacts after first crop cycle are1. 80\% farmers followed complete advisory, 15\% farmers skipped 2-3 steps in eight step advisory process, 5\% farmers did not follow the advisory. Various reasons were identified for not follow of the advisory, including change of crop by farmer, lack of seed germination, loss of mobile phone, not able to recharge phone battery, forgot the advisory etc.2. Reduction in input cost by 20\% in the first crop cycle, with 15\% increase in productivity. By second crop cycle 30\% reduction was observed with average productivity enhancement of 10\%. Measuring usability of advisory is part of the automated system through out-bound automated calls. Impact measurement of advisory on farm is not done as part of the process due to considerable cost involved in such exercises. Quantitative studies would require time and funding to undertake ground based observation monitoring for asses impact of such ICTs intervention.3. Greater awareness on soil nutrient management practices, benefits to soil health though not visible, but savings from inputs without loss in productivity have encouraged the farmers to continue using the service.4. Healthy soil, but results need to be verified over 2-3 crop cycle \&amp; soil test. An ideal usecase would be a controlled test area using advisory and other not using across several seasons to observe change in soil health.The service is ongoing and results are encouraging with farmers acceptance of the service being high. The branded service portfolio 'OneFarm' has been commercialised and is now available in Tamilnadu, Gujarat and Rajasthan. Ekgaon aims to grow the service to reach over 15 mn farmers in next five years for which it is seeking to raise investment.",,"Aditya, Vijay Pratap Singh and Sasikumar, K.",2013,10.1145/2442882.2442932,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/2442882.2442932,"Bangalore, India",

LMS Weds WhatsApp: Bridging Digital Divide Using MIMs,"Recently, Mobile Instant Messaging Services (MIMs) such as WhatsApp have shown tremendous potential in enabling communication among diverse set of people. Such services have an even more critical role to play in developing regions. Due to the digital divide, a much higher prevalence of mobile-only internet connection has been reported, where millions of users leapfrogged to mobile-internet entirely skipping the desktop-based internet phase. In this paper, we report findings from a longitudinal field study conducted in a private higher education institution in India. The aim of the study was to explore the potential of an integrated blended learning setup which combines WhatsApp with a Learning Management System (LMS). The study was performed in a class of 20 final year engineering students over a period of three months. Our findings suggest that there is a systematic bias in the usage of WhatsApp vs. LMS based on several factors, including specifics of the learning activity, student behavior, and status of the course in the semester, and the time of the day.

One of the mandates of C-MMACS is to provide HPC access to the scientific workforce of CSIR which is nearly 4500 strong. The early HPC initiatives began in the CSIR National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL) with the installation of Univac computer in the year 1984 prior to the establishment of C-MMACS. By 1994 the Univac system was retired and C-MMACS established the first supercomputer of CSIR: Convex C3820 with two vector processors and 240 Mflops speed. From then on, the HPC capability has largely been concentrated in C-MMACS and has grown over the years at a steady rate. In the year 2005, CSIR IGIB established a compute cluster which was the fastest in CSIR and second best in India. Apart from this, all major HPC infrastructure is being planned, installed and operated by C-MMACS for CSIR. By October 2012, C-MMACS will have India's fastest supercomputer rated at 300 Teraflops sustained on HPL. This is a major leap from earlier installation of 133 Teraflops system by CRL, India. With CSIR's vision to embrace simulation and data centric science, C-MMACS is presently engaged in planning for state-of-the-art high performance computing system during the 12th Five Year Plan (2012-17).The application environment in C-MMACS HPC facility is rich with in-house developed, open source and commercial software. Some of the key applications include CFD (primarily in-house), weather and climate (MOM, WRF), chemistry, material sciences and molecular modelling.C-MMACS will be looking very keenly at the upcoming accelerator technologies in order to ensure that the future large scale high performance computing is realized with as low a power infrastructure as possible but yet with minimal developmental effort from the users to extract maximum performance. Efforts are already on in this direction.",,"Thangavelu, R. P. and Mudkavi, Vidyadhar Y. and Seshu, P.",2012,,,"Buona Vista, Singapore",
SIGMIS-CPR '17: Proceedings of the 2017 ACM SIGMIS Conference on Computers and People Research,"It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the annual Computers and People Research Conference -- ACM SIGMIS CPR 2017. For more than 50 years, ACM SIGMIS CPR has engaged the academic and practitioner communities in understanding the issues related to the interaction of people with computers, what we now broadly refer to as information technology (IT). The current rapidly changing technological landscape is providing organizations and individuals with new tools for working, communication, and collaboration. Increasingly, smartphones and mobile commerce are changing our buying and consumer behaviors; wearable fitness trackers are making us more health conscious; social media and social networks are shifting the ways in which humans interact and collaborate together; start-ups are revamping business models by utilizing digital connections to fuel a sharing economy; and digital transformations are being used to address concerns of health, education, and civic engagement. A variety of social media and mobile technologies are also empowering individuals, communities, and societies to engage and interact with each other to enrich their own lives and to bring about a positive change in the world in which we live. In other words, digital technologies are enabling the transformation not only of business and organizations, but also of how people experience work and life. As a result, we selected the conference theme of Digital Transformation: The Changing Nature of Organizations, Work and Societies for this year's conference.The papers, posters, keynotes, and the industry-academia panel at the conference address topics and ideas related specifically to the conference theme in addition to the more traditional topics of the interaction between computers and people that the ACM SIGMIS CPR community typically addresses. Several papers and posters this year focus on the thematic topics of digital business and innovation, architecture of digital organizations, social media and social networks, digital empowerment, and digital health in addition to the topics of IT workforce management, software projects and outsourcing, IT security, and institutions and organizations. Of special note this year are two keynote addresses, one by Kris Gopalakrishnan, the co-founder of the iconic Indian IT services company Infosys, chairman of Axilor, and an IT industry pioneer, on the topic Changes in Globalisation \&amp; Indian IT Industry Transformation, and the other by Sunil Mithas, a prolific author, a highly-cited scholar, and a professor at the University of Maryland, on the topic Digital Intelligence and Transformations. Also of special note this year is an industry-academia panel that will address issues related to the conference theme and that is comprised of three senior IT executives who are directly shaping through their work the digital world we live in and will live in, and two professors who are engaged in understanding the digital transformation occurring around us and its implications on our work and our lives. To cap it all, an industry visit to Infosys is also planned so participants can see first-hand the Bangalore campus of this iconic Indian IT firm that many of us refer to in our courses, and engage directly with senior executives of this firm to understand their vision and their work in moving to the next stage of digital work. Last but not the least, the doctoral consortium at the conference provides an opportunity to doctoral students, who are the budding scholars of our discipline, to refine their scholarly ideas through their interactions with faculty mentors, many of whom are and were journal editors, and with fellow students, in addition to growing their professional networks.The various volunteer committees at any scholarly conference play a critical role in making it happen, and this conference is no exception. However, it is the authors, the reviewers, and many other volunteers and supporters who are really critical to the success of any conference. This conference in Bangalore, India would really not have been possible without the many authors and doctoral students who submitted their high-quality work, without the many reviewers who provided their timely and constructive reviews to submitted papers and doctoral proposals, and the faculty mentors who willingly agreed to give their time to interact with invited doctoral students in the doctoral consortium, and we would like to thank them all for their consideration and dedicated efforts.",,,2017,,,"Bangalore, India",
Perspectives on Teaching Computer Architecture in Developing Countries,"Different areas of computer science have different challenges with respect to curriculum development, textbook writing, and teaching. Computer architecture represents one extrema in this hyper-dimensional space: it is an applied discipline, the theory for many sub-areas is still in development, and unlike traditional theoretical areas, problem-solving and tutorial based teaching is still uncommon. Students typically appreciate the rigor of traditional algorithm courses because they are similar to the courses they have seen in high school, however computer architecture is an engineering discipline: it is a science, an art, and sometimes a combination of both. As the name suggests, it is quite like traditional ""architecture"" (designing beautiful buildings...). To further complicate matters, most textbooks in this subject have originally been written in the late nineties and fail to capture most of the developments that have happened over the last two decades, which are fundamental and revolutionary at the same time. In the late nineties the field was an applied discipline where the design of systems, the specific design choices made by engineers, and a description of important architectures was considered proper pedagogical practice. This was probably acceptable in developed countries where students had an adequate exposure to computers since their teenage years. However, this approach did not work in India and a few other developing countries where I taught. Hence, there was a need to grow the field and instead focus on providing timeless insights that are not dependent on specific architectures or specific technologies. There was a need to bring the field in line with other fields such as chemistry, physics, biology, and of course traditional CS (data structures, algorithms, discrete math, etc.). This was the nature of the challenge that I faced when I started writing my two books on computer architecture (www.basiccomparch.com and www.advcomparch.com). There was a need to formalize basic notions, provide a theoretical framework, and create a discipline that is more in line with traditional theoretical subjects, which the students (at least in developing countries) are more used to. Hence, a novel pedagogical approach was developed where the connect between Turing machines and basic architectures was shown. The same approach was followed to explain all the major concepts by relating them to other concepts in traditional math or CS: caches were connected with hashtables, virtual memory was connected with indexing, I/O was connected with networking, OOO processing was connected with graph algorithms, and memory models were re-explained with novel concepts developed by the verification community. The end result of doing so was 1500 pages of computer architecture (captured in my two books). Many concepts appear to be intuitive such as memory consistency and routing algorithms in on-chip networks. However, this never leads to a deeper understanding and cannot lead to practical designs because there is not enough knowledge to write real code and capture corner cases. This is where formal training and a connect with well-established CS concepts is required. In my second book on Advanced Computer Architecture, especially in the later half, I focused on power management, security, reliability, and architectures for AI/ML. Here again, the theory was not well developed and thus there were no popular mathematical formalisms. New notations and new theoretical tools were introduced to put these areas on a sound footing. This is by far the most important contribution of my two books, which is to formalize and ""mathematize"" concepts in computer architecture that hitherto had very applied definitions, which were often prone to misinterpretations. Towards the end of the talk, we will also digress into some of my other academic adventures such as co-chairing a committee to create the CBSE CS curriculum for schools, a lab course on processor design and kernel hacking (future of OS teaching), and my take on the future of teaching and learning (in general).",,"Sarangi, Smruti Ranjan",2022,10.1145/3561833.3568498,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3561833.3568498,"Jaipur, India",
IDEAS '10: Proceedings of the Fourteenth International Database Engineering \&amp; Applications Symposium,"The International Database Engineering \&amp; Applications Symposium (IDEAS) was established in 1997. IDEAS'10 is the fourteenth annual meeting in the IDEAS series and is being held in Montr\'{e}al, Qu\'{e}bec, Canada, during August 16-18, 2010. The conference aims to address the needs of the academic community in database and engineering, its application found in an ever increasing number of domains. It brings together academics, government and industry professionals to discuss recent progress and challenges in a broad range of areas in this domain such as data mining, databases, information retrieval, machine learning, as well as software engineering. IDEAS'10 also serves as a platform for theoreticians and practitioners to exchange their original research ideas on academic or application aspects of computing and engineering of database systems. They can present their new findings and share their experiences on integrating new technologies into products and applications. The symposium facilitates the discussion of their work as applied to real-life situations, and their development and operations of challenging database related systems, while identifying unsolved challenges.In terms of submissions, we have attracted many high-quality papers submitted by authors globally including: Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Iran, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Macedonia, Norway, Portugal and United States.For IDEAS'10, we continue to keep our tradition of inviting international experts in various aspects of database engineering to join our program committee. As a result, our Program Committee consists of professionals who have done an excellent job in finishing the single-blind review and on-line double-blind debate processes built into ConfSys. On average, about 97\% of reviews were submitted by the due date and about 3.85 reviews were received for each paper.Thus the paper selection process was thorough and competitive. On average, each paper was refereed by at least 3.85 reviewers, and about 17\% of submissions were accepted as full research papers. This year, we have an intensive program that spans over three days. In addition to full research papers we also include selected short papers and posters, which allow authors to present new applications and explore untried research directions.",,,2010,,,"Montreal, Quebec, Canada",
ISAFE: A Disaster Management Application Utilizing Georeferencing and A* Algorithm,"The occurrence of natural disasters increased through the years, and the Philippines remains as one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world, and have almost all types of hazards. Most of the Filipinos were not aware of the location of disaster-prone areas and evacuation centers, and a system is lacking that can show location of disaster-prone areas and evacuation areas; thus this mobile application was made which can provide the best route from the location of the user to the nearest evacuation center. The system utilized Geo Mapping, GPS, A* Algorithm and Prescriptive Analytics to make a system which can help the rescuers and the residents to have coordination in times of rescue operation. The developed system, iSAFE, can provide the exact location of the evacuation areas and disaster-prone areas in Los Ba\~{n}os, Laguna; and help rescuers by giving the location of other users through GPS in delivering immediate help. Other features include providing the best route which avoids disaster-prone areas to lessen the vulnerability index of users of the system, and prescribing an advisable number of rescuers to be deployed in every barangay. Further studies on the system can be done which target other provinces or municipalities.",,"Gulay, Crisanto F. and Subion, Marco Antonio T.",2018,10.1145/3293475.3293488,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3293475.3293488,"Phuket, Thailand",
MobiCom '15: Proceedings of the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking,"Welcome to ACM MobiCom 2015, the 21st Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking. MobiCom is the premier forum for publishing and presenting cutting-edge research in mobile systems and wireless networks. The technical program this year features 38 outstanding papers that cover a wide variety of topics including energy, sensing, security, wireless access, applications, localization, Internet of things, mobile cloud, measurement and analysis. We created a new Experience track this year to encourage authors to present extensive experiences with implementation, deployment, and operations of mobile ncomputing and wireless networks. One of the accepted papers is an Experience paper on cellular networks.This year's call for papers attracted 207 qualified submissions from across the globe that were carefully reviewed by 46 Technical Program Committee (TPC) members (+2 TPC chairs) along with a selected group of external experts. The TPC was formed with the goal of covering diverse research expertise as well as diverse perspectives and approaches. The TPC included researchers from 12 countries including China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, and USA. 25\% of the members were female, the highest ever in the history of MobiCom. We also had broad industry participation with TPC members from Alcatel-Lucent, Google, HP, IBM, Microsoft, NEC, and Telefonica.The paper review process was double-blinded and carried out in three phases. In the first phase, each paper was reviewed by at least three TPC members, and the top 112 papers were selected for the second phase. In addition to reviewer scores, reviewer confidence and normalization with respect to other papers in a reviewer's pile, were also considered in selecting papers. In the second phase, each paper was reviewed by at least two more reviewers followed by an online, often intense, discussion, producing 68 papers for the final phase. The final TPC meeting was held on May 28th and 29th in Salt Lake City, Utah. These 68 papers were organized by their topic areas, and discussed at length at the meeting. Eventually, 38 papers were shortlisted for inclusion in the program and a shepherd from the TPC was assigned to each of these papers. As the last step, each of the shortlisted papers was shepherded through a ""blind"" process where the authors interacted with all the reviewers and the shepherd to address the review comments without knowing the reviewers' or the shepherds' identities. The end result is an exciting technical program composed of 38 very high quality papers.During the review process, Prof. Robin Kravets, the TPC co-chair of MobiCom 2013, handled the papers that were co-authored by TPC chairs, and those that had conflict-of-interest with both TPC chairs. To ensure fairness and preserve the anonymity of all authors and reviewers, the assignment of reviewers, the reviews and discussions of these papers were done out of band without any exposure to the TPC chairs.",,,2015,,,"Paris, France",

IPv6: Issues and Solution for next Millennium of Internet,"IPv6 is coming, whether we like it or not. It isn't a matter of new features or ""killer applications,"" although those may come with time. Rather, it is the rapid depletion of the remaining IPv4 addresses that is leaving IPv6 as the only feasible alternative for the continued growth of networks beyond the next few years. Governments and service providers in many regions of the world have been cognizant of this fact for a long time, and are currently in various stages of planning for IPv6 deployment in their networks. The IPv6 was developed to replace and improve the existing Internet Protocol (IP), the IPv4 in many ways. Among the improved areas are addressing space, routing efficiency, header format, auto-configuration, Quality-of-Service (QoS), security and mobility.

The Software Engineering Impacts of Cultural Factors on Multi-Cultural Software Development Teams,"This paper is based on our experiences in trying to apply software engineering practices to development projects staffed by developers from three distinct cultures; Japan, India, and the United States. The development of commercial software products has always been difficult. The standard balancing act that occurs between features, schedules, and resources is at the core of the difficulty. We found that cultural differences also had a large impact on our software engineering work.Much has been written and said about software engineering methods that can be applied to development projects to reduce and control these core difficulties. Methods that were thought to be ""best practices"" turned out to be ineffective or very difficult to implement. Our understanding of the possible root causes for these difficulties greatly increased when we began to study some of the cultural dynamics within the team. This paper describes our observations in terms of how these cultural factors impacted the software engineering techniques used on the projects.",,"Borchers, Greg",2003,,,"Portland, Oregon",
ICEGOV '13: Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Theory and Practice of Electronic Governance,"The 7th International Conference on Theory and Practice of Electronic Governance, ICEGOV2013, took place in Seoul, Republic of Korea from 22 to 25 October 2013. The conference was organized under the patronage of the Ministry of Security and Public Administration of the Republic of Korea (MOSPA) by the National Information Society Agency and by Macao-based Center for Electronic Governance at United Nations University International Institute for Software Technology (UNU-IIST) as the founder and organizer of the ICEGOV series. The conference took place under the theme ""Beyond 2015"" Smart Governance, Smart Development"". It was co-located with the Global e-Government Forum, organized by MOSPA in collaboration with United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA).The ICEGOV series focuses on the use of technology to transform relationships between government and citizens, businesses, civil society and other arms of government (Electronic Governance). Established in 2007, the series looks beyond the traditional focus on technology-enabled transformation in government (Electronic Government) towards new forms, new paradigms, and new foundations for technology-enabled governance, collaboration and sustainable development. ICEGOV is a platform where researchers, policy-makers and practitioners meet; a platform where theories are tested, insights are shared and experiences are reported; a platform for network- and capacity-building where keynote lectures and paper sessions are complemented by plenary discussions, town hall debates and poster exhibitions; a platform for international dialogue attended by participants from developing, developed and transition countries, from the United Nations system, and from many academic, governmental, non-governmental and private sector organizations. Since its establishment, the series has traveled globally from Macao (ICEGOV2007), through Cairo (ICEGOV2008), Bogota (ICEGOV2009), Beijing (ICEGOV2010), Tallinn (ICEGOV2011) and Albany (ICEGOV2012), to Seoul (ICEGOV2013) all generating significant local interest and stakeholder engagement.The program of ICEGOV2013 was built upon contributions from researchers and practitioners from around the world. In response to the call for papers, the conference received 133 papers from 54 countries and economies. The papers were evaluated in five categories: 1) Completed Research Papers providing the outcomes of complete research in one or more aspects of EGOV, with proven capability to advance the state of research in the field, limited to 10 pages; 2) Ongoing Research Papers providing the outcomes of ongoing research in one or more aspects of EGOV, with potential capability to advance the state of research in the field, limited to 4 pages; 3) Completed Experience Papers describing completed experience concerning EGOV policy or practice innovations, with proven capability to advance the state of practice in the field, including critical success factors and insights on the challenges encountered and how they were addressed, limited to 10 pages; 4) Ongoing Experience Papers describing ongoing experience concerning EGOV policy and practice innovations, with potential capability to advance the state of practice in the field, including critical success factors and insights on the challenges encountered and how they are being addressed, limited to 4 pages; and 5) Poster Papers presenting novel ideas and initiatives with potential to advance the state of research or state of practice in the field, limited to 2 pages. In total, 43 Completed Research Papers, 45 Ongoing Research Papers, 17 Completed Experience Papers, 21 Ongoing Experience Papers and 8 Posters were received. After anonymous peer-review process carried out by the members of the Program Committee at least three independent reviews were obtained for each submission as a basis for acceptance decisions: 13 submissions were accepted as Completed Research Papers, 8 as Completed Experience Papers, 29 as Ongoing Research Papers, 11 as Ongoing Experience Papers and 21 as Poster Papers. All accepted submissions, revised to address review comments, and presented at the conference within 6 paper tracks, 11 thematic sessions and one poster session, are included in this volume. Among them, like the last three ICEGOV conferences, the authors of selected papers were invited to submit extended versions of their papers for possible publication in the special issue of Government Information Quarterly, Elsevier.Based on the submitted and invited contributions and continuing the ICEGOV tradition, ICEGOV2013 featured a rich academic, capacity-building and network-building program comprising keynote lectures, plenary discussions, town hall debates, paper tracks, thematic sessions and the doctoral colloquium and poster exhibition.

Measuring Performance Outcome of E-Governance Projects through ETaal,"Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DeitY) under Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, India and National Informatics Centre (NIC), the nodal information technology arm of Government of India, have developed Electronic Transaction Aggregation \&amp; Analysis Layer (eTaal). eTaal is an electronic dashboard providing real-time aggregated view of eServices delivered at different levels of governments - Central, State, District and sub-District (Tehsil/ Block) level. Accordingly the portal provides an aggregated view of e-Transactions performed through e-Governance applications implemented including, but not limited to, the national-level mission mode projects (MMPs) under the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP). The dashboard also facilitates quick analysis of data of various applications in tabular as well as graphical form enabling users to drill down to the lowest level of detail without compromising security and integrity of the servers from where data has been captured.The present system deals with quantitative analysis only, whereas, plan is afloat to develop eTaal 2.0 to address the qualitative aspects of service delivery, thereby, bringing in the concept of 'QUANTILITY', which means 'QUANTIty' with 'quaLITY'.",,"Dash, Shefali and Sethi, I.

Technology Management Framework for Smart University System in the Philippines,"In this study, the Smart University came out of the concept of smart cities by applying the principles of smart cities to the operation of university. The Smart University is a vision where the University, as a platform, provides foundational context data to deliver the university of the future. To deal with this reality, the researcher developed a framework for transforming a traditional university into a Smart University, which is more efficient, effective, and has more involvement from both students and teachers, all working together to accomplish the shared goal of improved learning. To achieve this objective, the researchers propose to develop a Technology Management Framework that will address issues and challenges to be considered in establishing and adopting a Smart University in the Philippines. The study will also measure the level of preparedness on Smart Universities among the students, teachers, university administrators, and IT consultant and practitioners that serve in different government agencies. Finally, the paper will also address adaptability of universities and to measure the Level of Smartness of Universities in Metro Manila.This study adopts a mixed-method approach that combines qualitative and quantitative research approaches. The authors also used the sequential exploratory design method. The researchers applied the Nominal Group Technique to acquire knowledge from the group of experts for the qualitative portion of the study. Cronbach's alpha is used by the authors for the designed survey instruments that are taken from the Nominal group. Cronbach's alpha is a tool used to evaluate the internal consistency, or reliability, of a collection of scale or test items. The researchers used the Friedman non-parametric hypothesis test for the Level of Smartness ranking.The outcome of the survey instrument uncovers the strength and weaknesses based on the Level of Smartness every university participant. The authors concluded that the developed Technology Management Framework for Smart University System in the Philippines is aligned with the literature and the available systems and applications. These standards are clustered in the three pillars and five criteria, which will guide the academic institutions on establishing Smart University. The three pillars are Technology Infrastructure, Educational Pedagogy, and Government Collaboration together with the five major criteria (Learning Environment, Educational Technology, Academic System, Governance, Health Services) and the application of a roadmap will support the success rate of Smart University in the Philippines. This leads to increasing the efficiency and responsiveness of the academic institution, holistic educational system, dynamic \&amp; safer academic community, and exceptional student experience.",,"Fernando Raguro, Ma.

The Paper Slip Should Be There! Perceptions of Transaction Receipts in Branchless Banking,"Mobile-based branchless banking has become a key mechanism for enabling financial inclusion in the developing world. A key component of all branchless banking systems is a mechanism to provide receipts to users after each transaction as evidence for successful transaction completion. In this paper, we present results from a field study that explores user perceptions of different receipt delivery mechanisms in the context of a branchless banking system in India. Our study shows that users have an affinity for paper receipts: despite the provision of an SMS receipt functionality by the system developers and their discouragement of the use of paper, users have pro-actively initiated a practice of issuing and accepting paper receipts. Several users are aware of the security limitations of paper receipts but continue to use them because of their usability benefits. We conclude with design recommendations for receipt delivery systems in branchless banking.",,"Panjwani, Saurabh and Ghosh, Mohona and Kumaraguru, Ponnurangam and Singh, Soumya Vardhan",2013,10.1145/2493190.2493236,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/2493190.2493236,"Munich, Germany",
Metamouse: Improving Multi-User Sharing of Existing Educational Applications,"Many children, especially in the developing world, must share a computer at school. Often, more advanced or aggressive students dominate, leaving others frustrated and disengaged. One promising approach is to provide each student with their own input device, usually a mouse, while sharing a common computer and display. Previous multiple mouse sharing efforts for education have relied on developing custom applications that encourage collaboration --- for example, by requiring that all users click on an icon or option to proceed. Implementing this requires access to application source code, which is unlikely to be available, and would require significant engineering effort to adapt even if it was. To address these limitations, we developed Metamouse. Metamouse only conveys clicks to the application when users have already agreed on a screen location, within a pre-defined tolerance (a novel sharing technique that we call ""location-voting"") and requires no access to the application source code. We have implemented two versions of location-voting --- one that requires all users to agree (""Consensus""), and another where only a majority is required (""Majority""). To evaluate Metamouse, we conducted a user study with 24 fifth-grade students in a low-income school in Bangalore, India. Our results demonstrate that Metamouse is intuitive, usable and has the potential to outperform other sharing strategies in terms of user engagement, generating discussion, and overall satisfaction. We also show that the Majority approach provides all of these benefits as effectively as Consensus with less frustration for faster users and less embarrassment for slower ones.",,"Heimerl, Kurtis and Vasudev, Janani and Buchanan, Kelly G. and Parikh, Tapan and Brewer, Eric",2010,10.1145/2369220.2369237,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/2369220.2369237,"London, United Kingdom",
Evaluation of the Application of Six Sigma Method in Moroccan SMEs Using the Hybrid SWOT-FAHP Model,"The Six Sigma method brings direct gains for the company as well as customer satisfaction. It allows better use of human and financial resources and production tools in order to improve performance. It also increases productivity by reducing non-quality. Six Sigma thus creates a dynamic of continuous progress making it possible to launch large-scale projects such as new products or new processes, thus increasing the competitiveness of the company and therefore its profits. Despite its benefits in terms of cost reduction and variability, many manufacturing companies, especially Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), are reluctant to apply it because it is a method that requires many skills within the company. This paper aims to examine the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) related to the application of Six Sigma method in Moroccan SMEs. Because of the lack of determination of importance ranking for SWOT factors, we proposed to improve the SWOT analysis with a multi-criteria decision-making technique called Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP). The objective of using the hybrid SWOT-FAHP model is to systematically qualify the SWOT groups and assimilate their intensities using fuzzy numbers that deal with the uncertainty and subjectivity of human decisions.",,"Karim, Yousra and Cherkaoui, Abdelghani",2022,10.1145/3543106.3543132,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3543106.3543132,"Seoul, Republic of Korea",
Modeling of Human Movement Behavioral Knowledge from GPS Traces for Categorizing Mobile Users,"Human movement analysis and categorization of mobile users based on their movement semantics are challenging tasks. Further, due to security and privacy issues, insufficient labeled or user-annotated data (or, ground-truth data) makes the user-classification from GPS traces more complex. In this work, we present a framework which models user movement patterns containing both spatio-temporal and semantic information, generates semantic stay-point taxonomy by analysing GPS traces of all users, summarizes individuals' GPS traces and clusters users based on the semantics of their movement patterns. To alleviate labelled data scarcity problem while user categorization in a particular region of interest (ROI), we propose a method to transfer knowledge derived from a set of GPS traces of a geographically distanced but similar type of ROI. An extensive set of experiments using real GPS trace dataset of Kharagpur, India and Dartmouth, Hanover, USA have been carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.",,"Ghosh, Shreya and Ghosh, Soumya K.",2017,10.1145/3041021.3054150,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3041021.3054150,"Perth, Australia",
Reverse Annotation Based Retrieval from Large Document Image Collections,"A number of projects are dedicated to creating digital libraries from scanned books, such as Google Books, UDL, Digital Library of India (DLI), etc. The ability to search in the content of document images is essential for the usability and popularity of these DLs. In this work, we aim toward building a retrieval system over 120K document images coming from 1000 scanned books of Telugu literature. This is a challenge because: i) OCRs are not robust enough for Indian languages, especially the Telugu script, ii) the document images contain large number of degradations and artifacts, iii) scalability to large collections is hard. Moreover, users expect that the search system accept text queries and retrieve relevant results in interactive times.We propose a Reverse Annotation framework [1], that labels word-images by their equivalent text label in the offline phase. Reverse Annotation applies a retrieval based approach to recognition. Unlike traditional annotation/recognition that identifies keywords for data, Reverse Annotation identifies data that corresponds to a given keyword. It first selects a set of keywords which are considered useful for labeling and retrieval, such as those that repeat often, and ignoring stopwords and rare-words. Exemplars are obtained for each word from a crude OCR or human annotations. The labels are then propagated across the rest of the collection by matching words in the image-feature space. Since such a matching is computationally expensive, scalability is achieved using a fast approximate nearest neighbor technique based on Hierarchical K-Means. Once text labels are assigned, each document image is considered a bag-of-words over the labeled keywords. A standard search engine is used to build a search index for quick online retrieval. An example query and the retrieved results are shown in Figure 1. We are unaware of any conventional OCRs which can retrieve such images for the given query.There are three major contributions of our work: i) recognizing the entire document collection together, instead of one-at-a-time; this means that the repetition of words in the test set is effectively used for improving accuracy, ii) speeding up recognition by clustering multiple instances of a given word, iii) recognising at the word-level, avoiding the pitfalls of character segmentation and recognition. Other OCR techniques that use word-level context still rely on inaccurate component-level classification.Using the techniques developed from this work, we were able to successfully build a retrieval system over our challenging dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest collection of document images that has been made searchable for any Indian language. Our algorithm is easily scalable to larger collections, and directly applicable to documents from other language scripts.The first issue to discuss, is the fraction of word-images that remain unrecognized at the end of the Reverse Annotation phase. Rare-words, nouns etc. are not labeled in the test set. It is important to estimate the cost of not being able to answer such queries. If this cost is indeed high, we need to explore methods to label such infrequently occurring words in the collection. Needless to say, such methods should be computationally efficient without compromising on accuracy.The other major issue to discuss is the evaluation of retrieval results. The true recall of the retrieval system cannot be computed, since it is impossible to identify every occurrence of the given query in such large data. Questions to be considered include: whether precision alone is a sufficient indicator of retrieval performance; whether there is some better document-level effectiveness assessment possible; and how best to estimate the relative satisfaction of the user's information need.",,"K., Pramod Sankar",2010,10.1145/1835449.1835694,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/1835449.1835694,"Geneva, Switzerland",

This year's workshop took place in Bangalore, India on November 30th 2010.The MidSens workshop series has contributed to the definition of appropriate middleware architectures and programming models for sensor networks. In particular, this year's workshop will investigate middleware approaches for realizing multi-application, shared infrastructure sensor networks along with methodologies for integrating sensor networks with enterprise architectures.In line with these objectives, the MidSens'10 proceedings provide an overview of current research to (1) the coordination and management of sensor networks and (2) component based software engineering approaches for wireless sensor networks.Firstly, three papers provide support for the coordination and management of sensor networks. Through the provision of better coordination and management functionality, these papers allow for the realization of larger and more complex sensor networks.Secondly, two papers investigate the application of run-time reconfigurable component models to sensor network application development. Through the use of concrete interfaces, these models promote reuse. In addition, run-time reconfiguration may be used to tailor system behavior to meet changing application requirements.We are convinced that the mix of accepted papers provides a high quality and timely snapshot of state-of-the-art research in the field, as well as a jumping-off point for discussion of outstanding challenges in middleware for sensor networks.",,,2010,,,"Bangalore, India",
“It Cannot Do All of My Work”: Community Health Worker Perceptions of AI-Enabled Mobile Health Applications in Rural India,"Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) suggest that AI applications could transform healthcare delivery in the Global South. However, as researchers and technology companies rush to develop AI applications that aid the health of marginalized communities, it is critical to consider the needs and perceptions of the community health workers (CHWs) who will have to integrate these AI applications into the essential healthcare services they provide to rural communities.

Estimating Travel Time of Dhaka City from Mobile Phone Call Detail Records,"Traffic jam in Dhaka city, the capital of Bangladesh and one of the most densely populated cities in the world, is one of the major problems of the commuters. The city dwellers have been experiencing intolerable traffic jam everyday. To reduce the traffic congestion, new roads have been built and new rules for vehicles in the roads have been enforced. These changes do not result in any visible improvement of the traffic condition. One major bottleneck for not being able to take appropriate measure for combating traffic jam is the inability to assess and predict the traffic condition of the road. Due to huge infrastructural cost, the city does not have facility to collect traffic data by deploying sensors. In this paper, we overcome this limitation by exploiting mobile phone call details record (CDR) data collected by mobile phone operators for billing purpose. We propose a methodology to estimate travel time between any two major locations of Dhaka city from the aggregated information of a high volume of users' mobile phone CDR data. Our experimental results on real CDR data set of 2.87 millions of users of the largest mobile operator, Grameenphone Ltd., show that we can effectively predict travel time between any two major junctions and any two minor locations of the city with an average accuracy of 87\% and 76\% respectively.",,"Hasan, Md.

CSTST '08: Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Soft Computing as Transdisciplinary Science and Technology,"Soft Computing (SC) has an evolving collection of methodologies, which is aimed to exploit tolerance for imprecision uncertainty, and partial truth to achieve robustness, tractability, and low cost. SC provides attractive opportunity to represent the ambiguity in human thinking with real life uncertainty. Fuzzy logic (FL), Neural Networks (NN), and Evolutionary Computation (EC) were the core methodologies of soft computing. Later chaos computing, fractal theory, wavelet transformation, cellular automaton, percolation models, and immune network theory were added to enhance soft computing. However, they should not be viewed as competing with each other, but synergistic and complementary, instead. SC was actually the combination or fusion of each methodology which yielded new computational capabilities (hybrid systems). Soft computing is currently causing a paradigm shift (breakthrough) in science and technology.The stage for the Fifth IEEE/ACM International Conference on Soft Computing as Transdisciplinary Science and Technology (CSTST'08) has been set. This edition is dedicated to commemorate the memory of Professor Yasuhiko Dote, Founding Chair of WSTST series of meetings. In essence, CSTST'08 is built on the success of the previous four events held in Muroran, Japan namely the IEEE International Workshop on Neuro Fuzzy Control, in 1993; IEEE International Workshop on Soft Computing in Industry, in 1996, the IEEE International Workshop on Soft Computing in Industry, in 1999 and International Workshop on Soft Computing as Transdisciplinary Science and Technology (WSTST'2005).

Efficiency of Electronic Public Service Delivery in India: Public-Private Partnership as a Critical Factor,"The dynamics of public administration in India have altered drastically with the introduction of e-governance as a guiding concept in the late 1980s. Citizens, the world over, have been demanding smaller, effective and responsive governments, obviously inspired by the unprecedented and rapid success of finance capital in the global market. Consequently, policy makers began the search for smaller and efficient governments. On an evolutionary plane, reengineering of service systems, performance management, transparency in government operations, down sizing or right sizing the government workforce, emphasis on delivery of reliable public services and ultimately citizen satisfaction came to be considered as benchmarks by most of the administrators. Quick decision-making, data-based planning, effective implementation through quantitative techniques seemed to have clinched the issue. This reformative pattern was no different in the Indian context, where the governments at the federal and state levels were in search of new techniques and technologies.Information technology has been found to be very useful in reinvigorating the government administrative systems by enhancing their capacity and efficiency. The potential and scope for application of IT in governing processes and transactions are enormous. E-government can transform traditional administrative systems through employment of information and communication technologies. A governance system that is committed to working with civil society, and by extension, private industry in a transparent and accountable way to reduce poverty, redress imbalances in access to resources, foster security and uphold social, economic, cultural, civil and political rights is the ultimate objective of e-governance theory. In practice, much depends on the collaboration patterns that the governments seek to establish.E-governance practices in India emerged and evolved mainly from native intuition, but under prescription for lesser and transparent government by international financial institutions, mainly the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. However, the range of success of e-governance initiatives has not been uniform. The bottom-up demand for delivery of electronic services was bleak initially, but the change in public perception was for the better with the governments roping in private industry and service-oriented organizations gradually.The Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model as is construed normally in a world that is fast witnessing globalization of all businesses and administrative trends, especially in the realm of e-governance, involves features such lesser government investment in electronic delivery of public services, collaboration in conceptualizing, designing and implementing the e-governance projects besides increased participation of stakeholders -- both private and public -- to saturate the levels and the reach of such projects. India is no exception to the general rule dictating PPP mode in e-governance.The unprecedented success of the PPP modules in e-governance in India can be rightly established with two path-breaking e-governance models - e-Seva in the state of Andhra Pradesh and Bhoomi in Karnataka. These projects not only caused a jump in revenue collections of the two state governments, but also timely payment by the citizens. Time and costs for availing public services have come down drastically bringing in a positive change in peoples' perception of e-governance theory and practice. This holds equally true for both the rural and urban populace. The result of all these radical changes in public administration systems is the enhanced satisfaction level of the citizenry on delivery of public services and simplification of governmental procedures. The above mentioned e-government projects can serve as models for all the developing societies.",,"Pardhasaradhi, Y. and Ahmed, Safdar",2007,10.1145/1328057.1328133,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/1328057.1328133,"Macao, China",

A Benchmarking Model Based on Research Performance Indicators of Engineering Institutions: A Principal Component Analysis,"The study presents the benchmarking model of rule-based decision tree for higher educational engineering institutions in India based on research performance indicators. The proposed model is built to train the engineering institutions for identifying homogeneous group of institutions in form in clusters. The top 100 engineering institutions ranked in five ranking exercises have been considered for the proposed model. A total of ten featured data variables have been considered as high-dimensional space which are considered as academic and research performance indicators. The principal component analysis is applied to transform the high-dimensional featured data space to principal components with maximum variations explained by featured data variables. Two decision trees are obtained from the proposed model based on the publications indexed in Scopus and citations received against publications. Decision trees are achieved in form of rule-based classifier for grouping cluster of homogeneous engineering institutions based on research performance indicators i.e., publications and citations.",,"Solanki, Hiteshkumar Harshadbhai and Virparia, Paresh",2023,10.1145/3590837.3590911,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3590837.3590911,"Jaipur, India",
"Respeak: A Voice-Based, Crowd-Powered Speech Transcription System","Speech transcription is an expensive service with high turnaround time for audio files containing languages spoken in developing countries and regional accents of well-represented languages. We present Respeak - a voice-based, crowd-powered system that capitalizes on the strengths of crowdsourcing and automatic speech recognition (instead of typing) to transcribe such audio files. We created Respeak and optimized its design through a series of cognitive experiments. We deployed it with 25 university students in India who completed 5464 micro-transcription tasks, transcribing 55 minutes of widely-varied audio content, and collectively earning USD 46 as mobile airtime. The Respeak engine aligned the transcript generated by five randomly selected users to transcribe Hindi and Indian English audio files with a word error rate (WER) of 8.6\% and 15.2\%, respectively. The cost of speech transcription was USD 0.83 per minute with a turnaround time of 39.8 hours, substantially less than industry standards. Using a mixed-methods analysis of cognitive experiments, system performance and qualitative interviews, we evaluate Respeak's design, user experience, strengths, and weaknesses. Our findings suggest that Respeak improves the quality of speech transcription while enhancing the earning potential of low-income populations in resource-constrained settings.",,"Vashistha, Aditya and Sethi, Pooja and Anderson, Richard",2017,10.1145/3025453.3025640,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3025453.3025640,"Denver, Colorado, USA",

Mobile Health System Framework in India,"The healthcare system in India has been progressive with the specific health policies evolved over a period of time. Currently, it is in a phase of incorporating mobile technology into healthcare service delivery (i.e., mobile health) to make it a patient-centric model for managing acute, chronic, and preventive health conditions. This provides authentic interactions between the patient/user and the healthcare professionals for seeking health communication and information during emergencies and disaster conditions. However, there exists a great challenge in integrating mobile health solutions within the existing system and acceptance among the individuals, as the patient data is primarily collected through sensors and while the interventions are connected electronically. With this aim, the present research by using qualitative interviews (among residents and technology entrepreneurs) attempts to propose a provenance framework for the mobile health system in India. It also highlights its strengths and weakness and delineates components identified from qualitative interviews for describing the proposed provenance framework.",,"R.

Accurate Speed and Density Measurement for Road Traffic in India,"Monitoring traffic density and speed helps to better manage traffic flows and plan transportation infrastructure and policy. In this paper, we present techniques to measure traffic density and speed in unlaned traffic, prevalent in developing countries, and apply those techniques to better understand traffic patterns in Bengaluru, India. Our techniques, based on video processing of traffic, result in about 11\% average error for density and speed compared to manually-observed ground truth values. Though we started with intuitive and straight-forward image processing tools, due to a myriad of non-trivial issues posed by the heterogeneous and chaotic traffic in Bengaluru, our techniques have grown to be non-obvious. We describe the techniques and their evaluation, with details of why simpler methods failed under various circumstances. We also apply our techniques to quantify the congestion during peak hours and to estimate the gains achievable by shifting a fraction of traffic to other time periods. Finally, we measure the fundamental curves of transportation engineering, relating speed vs. density and flow vs. speed, which are integral tools for policy makers.",,"Sen, Rijurekha and Cross, Andrew and Vashistha, Aditya and Padmanabhan, Venkata N. and Cutrell, Edward and Thies, William",2013,10.1145/2442882.2442901,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/2442882.2442901,"Bangalore, India",
ASE '14: Proceedings of the 29th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Automated Software Engineering,"It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 29th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE 2014). This conference publication contains the proceedings of ASE 2014, held in Vsters, Sweden, on September 15-19, 2014. The ASE Conference series is the premier research forum for automating software engineering. Each year, it brings together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to discuss foundations, techniques and tools for automating the analysis, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance of large software systems.It is a wonderful time to do research in automated software engineering! Everything is becoming programmable -- phones, TVs, tablets, cars, and even watches and glasses. Software engineers are the ones who bring life to these programmable devices by writing systems and applications software. As software engineering researchers, we are the ones who are tasked with developing techniques and tools that will help software engineers in meeting the exploding demand in software production. We are facing an endless list of research problems that not only bring many challenges, but also bring many opportunities for contribution and impact.ASE 2014 was located in Vster\r{a}s, Sweden's sixth largest city with a 1000-year-old history. Vster\r{a}s is a cultural, educational, and industrial city located by the beautiful Lake M\""{a}laren. The city is the home of ABB's largest research center and it hosts other major companies like Bombardier Transportation, Westinghouse Electric Sweden, Alstom Power Sweden, Luvata Sweden, Enics Sweden, and nearby placed Volvo Construction Equipment.The exciting program of this year's ASE conference consisted of high quality contributions in this vibrant research area that were selected from a record number of submissions after a careful, thorough and selective reviewing process. This year, for the main track of the ASE conference, we invited three categories of submissions: (1) Technical Research Papers that describe innovative research in automating software development activities or automated support to users engaged in such activities; (2) Experience Papers that describe a significant experience in applying automated software engineering technologies and identify and discuss important lessons learned so that other researchers and/or practitioners can benefit from the experience; and (3) New Ideas Papers that describe novel research directions in automated software engineering that are in an early stage of investigation.We received 337 paper submissions this year -- a record for the ASE conference series! Thirteen submissions were desk rejected without review since they failed to follow the instructions given in the call for papers or were clearly out of scope of the conference. One paper was rejected as a double submission with another conference. The remaining 323 submissions -- 276 full papers and 48 new idea papers -- were reviewed by the members of the Program Committee and the Expert Review Panel, with each paper receiving at least 3 reviews. We also had a very active online discussion phase, with many long and detailed discussions among the members of the Program Committee and the Expert Review Panel. During a two-day physical PC meeting held at the University of Toronto on June 25--26, 2014, the members of the Program Committee compiled the final selection of papers to be presented at ASE 2014. This careful and thorough reviewing process resulted in selection of 50 technical research papers, 5 experience papers, and 27 new ideas papers (many of these were recategorized full papers).In addition to the papers presented in the main track, the ASE conference program also included 12 tool demonstration papers selected by the Tools Program Committee, and 10 doctoral symposium papers, selected by the Doctoral Symposium Committee. Two workshops and three tutorials were selected by the Tutorials and Workshops Program Committee and were co-located with the conference.

Social Interactions in P2P Lending,"Access to capital in the form of credit through money lending requires that the lender to be able to measure the risk of repayment for a given return. In ancient times money lending needed to occur between known parties or required collateral to secure the loan. In the modern era of banking institutions provide loans to individuals who meet a qualification test. Grameen Bank in Bangladesh has demonstrated that small poor communities benefited from the ""microcredit"" financial innovation, which allowed a priori non-bankable entrepreneurs to engage in self-employment projects. Online P2P (Peer to Peer) lending is considered an evolution of the microcredit concept, and reflects the application of its principles into internet communities. Internet ventures like Prosper.com, Zopa or Lendingclub.com, provide the means for lenders and borrowers to meet, interact and define relationships as part of social groups. This paper measures the influence of social interactions in the risk evaluation of a money request; with special focus on the impact of one-to-one and one-to-many relationships. The results showed that fostering social features increases the chances of getting a loan fully funded, when financial features are not enough to construct a differentiating successful credit request. For this task, a model-based clustering method was applied on actual P2P Lending data provided by Prosper.com.",,"Herrero-Lopez, Sergio",2009,10.1145/1731011.1731014,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/1731011.1731014,"Paris, France",

BenLem (A Bengali Lemmatizer) and Its Role in WSD,"A lemmatization algorithm for Bengali has been developed and evaluated. Its effectiveness for word sense disambiguation (WSD) is also investigated. One of the key challenges for computer processing of highly inflected languages is to deal with the frequent morphological variations of the root words appearing in the text. Therefore, a lemmatizer is essential for developing natural language processing (NLP) tools for such languages. In this experiment, Bengali, which is the national language of Bangladesh and the second most popular language in the Indian subcontinent, has been taken as a reference. In order to design the Bengali lemmatizer (named as BenLem), possible transformations through which surface words are formed from lemmas are studied so that appropriate reverse transformations can be applied on a surface word to get the corresponding lemma back. BenLem is found to be capable of handling both inflectional and derivational morphology in Bengali. It is evaluated on a set of 18 news articles taken from the FIRE Bengali News Corpus consisting of 3,342 surface words (excluding proper nouns) and found to be 81.95\% accurate. The role of the lemmatizer is then investigated for Bengali WSD. Ten highly polysemous Bengali words are considered for sense disambiguation. The FIRE corpus and a collection of Tagore’s short stories are considered for creating the WSD dataset. Different WSD systems are considered for this experiment, and it is noticed that BenLem improves the performance of all the WSD systems and the improvements are statistically significant.",,"Chakrabarty, Abhisek and Garain, Utpal",2016,10.1145/2835494,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/2835494,,

Beyond the Pandemic and Privacy Concerns: Perceived Benefit and Expected Use of Pandemic-Tracking Apps in India,"Pandemic-tracking apps could be a viable pandemic-mitigation technique, although their efficacy has been weakened by limited adoption in many places. Therefore, it is important to investigate how the perceptions of such apps are formed in different regions, which may help explain the differences in adoption. We replicated prior work on the adoption of pandemic-tracking apps in the United States with participants from India (n = 236). We identified that the perceptions of pandemic-tracking apps are connected to social orientation, familiarity with health-related technology, and demographics. We found that the perceptions and expected use were uncorrelated with privacy concerns, suggesting that privacy may not necessarily be the most suitable lens for studying the adoption of pandemic-tracking apps in India. Based on the findings, we make several recommendations for future pandemic-preparedness campaigns and identify the need to continue the trend toward contextualizing privacy-centered research with privacy-adjacent individual factors across multiple regions.",,"Seberger, John S. and Patil, Sameer",2022,10.1145/3555596,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3555596,,

The topic is the integration of FPGAs into high-performance computing systems, with three speakers from industry to give their perspectives on this emerging topic.As FPGAs gain an even wider user base, the question of programming methods becomes more important, and the traditional FPGA evening panel will explore this topic, answering the question of whether high-level languages will address the future needs of FPGA programmers.",,,2007,,,"Monterey, California, USA",
"The Early International Activities in the Arpanet, Its Mutation into the Internet, and Some Further Regional Extensions","This talk will consider some of the activities involved in setting up the International Internet and its precursors. It will consider later efforts in promoting the technology in regions that it had not reached earlier. There will be consideration not only the technical development, but also the political climate which either encouraged or prevented its take-up. Moreover, the importance of personal networks at many stages of the story will be highlighted. I will consider why the first Arpanet service node was sited at UCL, how it grew to provide an international heterogeneous interconnection service until the late '80s, and how this differed from other European developments. This will include the governance put in place, the role of the Open Systems Interconnection rise and fall in Europe, and the growth of multi- agency support on both sides of the Atlantic. In parallel with the development of a UK-US service, an International Collaboration Board (ICB) was formed that fostered unclassified collaborations between certain European and American NATO defence departments. While the ICB was not very significant technically, how its success initiated broader US-European Internet extension will be described. Our emphasis on application services to the '90s will be outlined - message, directory, security and multimedia conferencing. Finally we will treat briefly the start of international networking in India around 1990, and the bringing the academics of Central Asia and the Caucasus into the Internet community.",,"Kirstein, Peter T.",2018,10.1145/3241539.3241588,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3241539.3241588,"New Delhi, India",
Speculative Vulnerability: Uncovering the Temporalities of Vulnerability in People's Experiences of the Pandemic,"Pandemic-tracking apps may form a future infrastructure for public health surveillance. Yet, there has been relatively little exploration of the potential societal implications of such an infrastructure. In semi-structured interviews with 23 participants from India, the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), and the United States, we discussed attitudes and preferences regarding the deployment of apps that support contact tracing to contain the spread of COVID-19. Through interpretive analysis, we examined the relationship between persistent discomfort and vulnerability when using such apps. Such an examination yielded three temporal forms of vulnerability: real, anticipatory, and speculative. By identifying and defining the temporalities of vulnerability through an analysis of people's pandemic-related thoughts and experiences, we develop the overlapping discourses of humanistic infrastructure studies and infrastructural speculation. In doing so, we explore the concept of vulnerability itself and present implications for the study of vulnerability in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and for the oversight of app-based public health surveillance.",,"Seberger, John S. and Obi, Ike and Loukil, Mariem and Liao, William and Wild, David J. and Patil, Sameer",2022,10.1145/3555586,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3555586,,

MobiCom '18: Proceedings of the 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking,"The 24th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking (ACM MobiCom 2018) is the premier international forum for disseminating significant, cutting-edge research in mobile systems and wireless networks. The technical program this year features 42 outstanding papers that cover a wide variety of topics including augmented reality, cellular networks, millimeter-wave networking, security, and localization. The program this year also includes an experience-track paper and a verification-track paper, reflecting contributions that present experiences in the deployment and operations of mobile systems and networks as well as contributions that seek to verify and/or characterize recent results using rigorous experimental methodology.This year's call for papers attracted 187 qualified submissions from across the globe that were carefully reviewed by 63 Program Committee (PC) members along with a selected group of 12 External Review Committee (ERC) experts. The PC was formed with the goal of covering diverse research expertise as well as diverse perspectives and approaches, and included researchers from 12 countries including China, France, Germany, Great Britain, India, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, and the United States. 18\% of the PC members were female and there was broad industry participation with PC and ERC members from Alcatel-Lucent, Google, IBM, Microsoft, NEC, and Telefonica. The PC this year was ""all-heavy,"" meaning that all members participated throughout the entire review and shepherding process.The paper review process was double-blind (both authors' and reviewers' identities were hidden from each other), and carried out in five phases: three review rounds, followed by an online discussion phase, and discussion at the PC meeting itself. In Round 1, each paper was reviewed by at least four PC members, with the top 122 papers selected for promotion to Round 2. In Round 2, each paper was reviewed by three more reviewers, with the top 92 papers selected for promotion to Round 3. Round 3 papers received between one and four further reviews, at the chairs' discretion, depending on the strength of their review scores as well as the confidence of those review scores. We are pleased to report evidence that the additional number of reviews helped the reliability of the review process: 15 papers had three Round 1 reviews all scoring either 1 or 2 (out of 4), yet eventually made it into Round 3 on the basis of a fourth first-round review score of 3 or above, and further high second-round scores.After Round 3, reviewers participated in an online discussion phase to come to an agreement on whether to promote each paper to discussion at the in-person PC meeting, based on an often-extensive technical exchange of each paper's merits and demerits. The online discussion phase resulted in 69 papers being promoted to discussion at the PC meeting, which was held on May 21-22 at Rutgers University in New Jersey. These 69 papers were organized by topic area, and discussed at length in the meeting. After the in-person PC meeting, 42 papers were selected to enter a new doublyanonymous shepherding process, which we describe next.",,,2018,,,"New Delhi, India",
Exploring Risk and Benefit Factors Affecting User Adoption Intention of Fintech in Indonesia,"The presence of Fintech as an innovative and disruptive financial service can improve the efficiency and scope of financial services through the application of technology. Fintech is considered to have various benefits. However, based on survey conducted by DailySocial and Otoritas Jasa Keuangan finds that the Fintech adoption rate in Indonesia is still relatively low at around 58.1\%, this is in line with a penetration level of Fintech in Asia which Indonesia usage level still in 5\% compared to China, Hong Kong, and India. In determining Fintech adoption, users tend to do rational calculations by comparing the perceived benefits and risks and will decide to adopt them when the perceived benefits are greater than the risks received. According to some studies, trust can be mediated to reduce some level of risk, thus this study will also include trust variables in the risk-benefit framework to determine user adoption intention on Fintech services in Indonesia. Based on data collected from 100 Fintech users, this study initially investigated whether perceived benefits and risks significantly impacted Fintech adoption intention. Partial Least Square (PLS-SEM) method is used to estimate the relationship between constructs. As a resulting trust, economic benefit and convenience are proven to significantly influence the user to adopt Fintech. While privacy awareness, financial risk, and legal risk are significantly affected by user trust. The hypothesis testing indicates that security risk has the biggest negative effect and convenience has the biggest positive effect on Fintech adoption intention.",,"Haqqi, Fannisa Rahma and Suzianti, Amalia",2020,10.1145/3400934.3400939,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3400934.3400939,"Depok, Indonesia",

Ontology Driven Sentiment Analysis on Social Web for Government Intelligence,"The World Wide Web as a global information medium has evolved radically from the first 'read only web' generation to the next participative- collaborative 'read and write' social web to the intelligent generation of web referred to as Semantic Web, the 'Read Write and Execute Web'. As a novel facet, digital governance intends to ensure and assure that stakeholders (government and citizens) have greater access and control over the governance mechanism which leads to a more transparent, accountable and efficient governance. Social media can be used to facilitate interaction between people and can offer a substantial, unparallel platform for extensive involvement of citizens in the governance measures. We propose using an ontology-based analytics on social media that expounds an intelligent governance model where sentiment can be mined for extracting views of citizens towards government practices, policies, rules and monitoring performance. The idea is to deploy ontology based techniques to determine the subjects/topics discussed in the tweets, which are related to Ministries of India: their policies, rules, schemes, and analyzing the sentiment (positive, negative and neutral) for tweets retrieved (based on the concepts defined in Ontology). The proposed tool SentIndiGov--O proffers a sentiment analysis application model based on ontologies, where the ontology IndiGov-O is created for ""Ministries of Government of India"" to reinforce the feature selection task in a Na\""{\i}ve Bayesian classification paradigm. The preliminary results with performance accuracy of ~77\% are encouraging and foster the need to exploit hybrid of concept based techniques and machine learning for sentiment analysis.",,"Kumar, Akshi and Joshi, Arunima",2017,10.1145/3055219.3055229,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3055219.3055229,"New Delhi AA, India",

Alternative Localization Approach for Mobile Phones without GPS,"Location is a primary indicator of context and forms the core basis of several context-aware applications. Most common way of getting location information is to use specialized hardware like GPS. However, GPS is expensive and is available only on high-end phones restricting its use to a smaller population in developing countries. Further, GPS also consumes a lot of battery power during its operation, thereby making it infeasible to run for longer durations with limited mobile phone battery. An alternative to GPS-based localization is GSM-based localization that is more suitable for developing countries due to much lower power consumption and ability to run even on low-end phones. Currently available, network-operator independent, GSM-based solutions require building perceptual map of cell towers in a city using war-driving.In this paper, we present a novel low cost GSM-based solution based on Cell Broadcast (CBS) Messages. Location accuracy in our approach does not depend on building extensive cell ID database, typically built using war-driving. We present empirical studies (performed in the sub-city of Dwarka, New Delhi, India) comparing location accuracy of our approach with other GSM-based localization scheme that uses one of the most extensive open source database of cell IDs. We also compare power consumption of our proposed solution with GPS-based localization leading to energy-accuracy tradeoff that can be further exploited for a hybrid solution.",,"Yadav, Kuldeep and Naik, Vinayak and Singh, Pushpendra and Singh, Amarjeet",2010,10.1145/1930028.1930029,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/1930028.1930029,"Bangalore, India",
A Monolithic 3D Design Technology Co-Optimization with Back-End-of-Line Oxide Channel Transistor,"Back-end-of-line (BEOL) compatible tungsten doped indium oxide (IWO) n-type channel transistor is proposed to achieve complementary logic operation with front-end-of-line (FEOL) p-type silicon transistor. To make the fully logic-voltage compatible, a novel stacked nanosheet structure of IWO transistor is designed to achieve high on-current density (Ion &gt; 544 μA/μm) at VGS=1 V to compensate the relative low mobility in semiconducting oxide (~20 cm2/Vs). We demonstrate its performance using Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD). For design-technology co-optimization of IWO transistors, a customized monolithic 3D (M3D) process design kit (PDK) and related standard cell library using transistor-level partition are developed to investigate the trade-offs in power, performance, and area (PPA) in representative logic circuit designs such as Advanced encryption standard (AES), triple data encryption algorithm (DES3), and low-density parity-check (LDPC) circuits.

Driver Fatigue Detection Using Recurrent Neural Networks,"Road accidents are becoming a real global scourge because of the high number of victims involved and the severe consequences that affect road users as well as their families.Despite the awareness campaigns on the vigilance and caution that must be undertaken on the road, deaths caused in road accidents are still increasing and are now considered as a major public health problem, more specifically in Morocco where the roads are among the most deadly.To address this issue, vehicle manufacturers have made considerable progress in improving the intelligence and capacity of vehicles to perceive and analyze road environments to prevent accidents and secure passengers. However, with all these efforts, accident statistics show that in most cases, accidents are related to the inattention of the drivers and sometimes irresponsible behavior.Therefore, considerable amount of research has recently been focused on the analysis and study of the general behaviors of drivers on the road, especially somnolence, as it is among the highest risk factors of accidents and is the leading cause of death on roads.In this paper, we propose a new approach to analyze driver drowsiness by applying a new recurrent neural network architecture to frame sequences of a driver.

Protocol for Hunting PM2.5 Emission Hot Spots in Cities,"Particulate Matter (PM) is a major air pollutant that has the potential for adversely affecting human health. Actionable data on the spatial distribution of temporal variability of PM2.5 emission hot spots in large cities are sparse. The main objective of this research is to provide a protocol for using search agents to hunt for PM2.5 emission hot spots in urban environments. We propose short range identification of variability of harmful PM2.5 concentrations can be achieved using IoT devices mounted on a mobile platform. We propose that long range identification the PM2.5 emission hot spots can attained by searching through the city on different days. We applied this approach to Hyderabad, India by fixing a mobile platform on a street car. We corrected the IoT device measurement errors by calibrating the sensing component data against a reference instrument co-located on the mobile platform. We identified that random forest regression was the most suitable technique to reduce the variability between the IoT devices. The spatial variability of PM2.5 harmful emission hot spots at industrial settings and congested roads were identified. The temporal variability based on image processing shows a weak correlation between PM2.5 concentrations and number of vehicles, and PM2.5 and visibility. The Hyderabad PM2.5 emission hot spots findings demonstrate a clear need to inform people with heart and lung conditions when it is unhealthy to be outside; and when it is unhealthy for children and elderly people to be outside for prolonged periods.

Second, we classify the tweets applying a qualitative typology to hashtags on the subjects of nationalism, corruption, religion and development. We find that the ruling BJP tended to promote itself over attacking the opposition whereas the main challenger INC was more likely to attack than promote itself. Moreover, while the INC gets more retweets on average, the BJP dominates Twitter's trends by flooding the online space with large numbers of tweets.

Integrated Election Voting System: A Model for Leveraging ICT in the Indian Election Scenario,"In India, Information and Communication technologies (ICT) are being increasingly deployed in almost each sector of economy including agriculture, health, transportation, and education. But when we analyze the Indian Election Voting Scenario, it is realized that the ICT has not been exploited to its fullest extent. Recently, the Election Commission of India (ECI) has introduced few ICT-enabled initiatives, but the application of advanced ICT technologies needs to be promoted in Indian Election Voting System. In this paper, we propose E-Voting System to provide for an additional channel of voting to the Indian electorate. Further, this paper proposes the deployment model ""Integrated Election Voting System"" that leverages ICT technologies to integrate the existing Electronic Voting Machine (EVM) System with the proposed E-Voting System to provide a solution to the problem of low voting percentages among the Indian electorate.

"Managing Microfinance with Paper, Pen and Digital Slate","India's extensive Self-Help Group (SHG) microfinance network brings formal savings and credit services to 86 million poor households. Yet, the inability to maintain high-quality records remains a persistent weakness in SHG functioning. We study this problem and present a financial record management application built on a low-cost digital slate prototype. The solution directly accepts handwritten input on ordinary paper forms and provides immediate electronic feedback. A field trial with 200 SHG members in rural India shows that the use of the digital slate solution results in shorter data recording time, fewer incorrect entries, and more complete records.

Bayesian Approach to Spatio-Temporally Consistent Simulation of Daily Monsoon Rainfall over India,"Simulation of rainfall over a region for long time-sequences can be very useful for planning and policy-making, especially in India where the economy is heavily reliant on monsoon rainfall. However, such simulations should be able to preserve known spatial and temporal characteristics of rainfall over India. General Circulation Models (GCMs) are unable to do so, and various rainfall generators designed by hydrologists using stochastic processes like Gaussian Processes are also difficult to apply over the highly diverse landscape of India. In this paper, we explore a series of Bayesian models based on conditional distributions of latent variables that describe weather conditions at specific locations and over the whole country. During parameter estimation from observed data, we use spatio-temporal smoothing using Markov Random Field so that the parameters learnt are spatially and temporally coherent. Also, we use a nonparametric spatial clustering based on Chinese Restaurant Process to identify homogeneous regions, which are utilized by some of the proposed models to improve spatial correlations of the simulated rainfall. The models are able to simulate daily rainfall across India for years, and can also utilize contextual information for conditional simulation. We use two datasets of different spatial resolutions over India, and focus on the period 2000--2015. We consider metrics to study the spatio-temporal properties of the simulations by the models, and compare them with the observed data to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the models.",,"Mitra, Adway",2017,10.1145/3139958.3139975,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3139958.3139975,"Redondo Beach, CA, USA",
IoT Based Monitoring of Container Vehicle for Secure and Reliable Delivery of Goods,"Designing a Secured Smart Transportation System for delivering goods to various Fair Price Shops is one of the major goals for all the state governments in the India. In this paper, a hardware model and an application is designed for tracking the moving good carrying vehicle. The data for the proposed application is generated from the different sensors such as Door sensors, Collision Prevention sensor, and GPS/GPRS devices that attached to the hardware model. An alarm is raised to make decision in case of trouble or malfunction. The data generated by these sensors are stored under cloud environment. An alert system is implemented using automatic alarm concept that placed inside goods carrying vehicle. If the current moving path of the vehicle has an obstacle then an alternate path is recommended by the proposed application using intelligent water drops algorithm. From the experiment, it is observed that the proposed hardware model and application meets the objective, such as monitoring the goods carrying container, speedy recovery in case of any incidents happened and secured delivery of ration food items to all the required fair price shops.",,"R, Sathish Kumar and C, Rani and P, GaneshKumar",2018,10.1145/3167132.3167201,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3167132.3167201,"Pau, France",
Associative Classification in the Prediction of Tuberculosis,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease caused by bacteria called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It usually spreads through the air and attacks low immune bodies. Human Immunodeficiency Virus(HIV) patients are more likely to be attacked with TB. It is an important health problem in India also. The application of association rule mining to classification has led to a new family of classifiers which are often referred to as Associative Classifiers (AC). An advantage of AC is that they are rule-based and if applied on medical datasets, lends themselves to an easier interpretation. It selects a small set of high quality rules and uses this rule set for prediction. This paper proposes classification of TB using classification based association(CBA) and classification based on multiple association rule(CMAR) techniques with our designed prototype model. It predicts the class label of unknown sample as Pulmonary Tuberculosis(PTB) or Retroviral Pulmonary Tuberculosis(RPTB) ie. TB along with HIV based on higher confidence rule.",,"Asha, T. and Natarajan, S. and Murthy, K. N.

A Machine Learning-Based Topic Extraction and Categorization of State Universities and Colleges (SUC) Customer Feedbacks,"Academic institutions collect an increasing amount of data through surveys. Aside from the usual numeric ratings obtained from the survey, the hierarchical concerns and sentiments can also be identified through the text-based customer feedbacks. These feedbacks contain text about customer experiences with the products offered and services delivered by an institution. A challenge in analyzing unstructured customer feedback is in making sense of the topics that are expressed in words used to describe these experiences.This study develops a model for text analysis of the customer feedbacks that exploits machine learning algorithms such as topic modeling. This further described the text mining process steps undergone in extracting useful information from the customer survey feedbacks of one of the SUCs in the Philippines, the Bicol State College of Applied Sciences and Technology (BISCAST).

Counting to Be Counted: Anganwadi Workers and Digital Infrastructures of Ambivalent Care,"Data collection on the population is a key mode of public health management in the Global South. This information is seen as a means to improve health metrics through welfare programs. In this study, we examine the changes brought about by an ICT-based Real-Time Monitoring System to the infrastructure of a welfare program and the nature of work of Anganwadi workers in India. Anganwadi workers, traditionally serving as daycare providers and community health workers, are increasingly being asked to serve primarily as data collectors for the new digital system. We ask the question 'cui bono?' to this system by drawing attention to the precarity of Anganwadi workers whose care-work is standardized through this app for 'efficient' monitoring by the Indian state but remains contingent on their relationship with the local community and ability to mobilize resources on the ground. Using auto-ethnographic and interview methods, we find that Anganwadi workers are caught between conflicting demands of state bureaucracy and the situated nature of their care work resulting in forms of ambivalent care. We find that the real-time monitoring apps intended to collect data for efficient delivery of state services end up serving the state's need for performing care through data rhetorics produced at the expense of the professional and personal well-being of the workers, and arguably the communities they serve.",,"S P, Azhagu Meena and Vaghela, Palashi and Pal, Joyojeet",2022,10.1145/3555177,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3555177,,
Connecting the Unconnected: Innovations in Mobile Government in the Indian State of Andhra Pradesh,"Mobile penetration in the hinterland of many developing economies, including India, has helped in digital inclusion of the weaker sections of the society. In this study, an innovation in mobile government - the digital gram pratinidhi (DGP) or the village digital representative - is described where electronic public services are made available to the unconnected rural population in the geographically remote districts of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh (AP) through a tablet device. This innovation is implemented by the government through a public private partnership model. Using data from the government records, the study identifies the determinants of success and adoption of the DGP program through econometric estimation. The study provides some evidence that men recruited as DGP, earn higher incomes through dispensing a higher volume of e-public transactions in the unconnected villages, as compared to their women counterparts. Some weak evidence shows that the men DGP be holders of an educational degree, and preferably be in their twenties.

A Geocoding Framework Powered by Delivery Data,"Over the last decade, India has witnessed an explosion in the ecommerce industry. There is increasing adoption of e-commerce in smaller towns and cities over and above the densely populated urban centers. In this paper, we discuss the practical challenges involved with developing high-precision geocoding engines for these geographical regions in India. These challenges motivate the next iteration of our geocoding framework. In particular, we focus on addressing three core areas of improvement: 1) leveraging customer delivery data for geocoding, 2) understanding and solving for the diversity and variations in addresses for these new regions, and 3) overcoming the limited coverage of our reference corpus. To this end, we present GeoCloud. Key contributions of GeoCloud are 1) a training algorithm for learning reference-representations from delivery coordinates and 2) a retrieval algorithm for geocoding new addresses. We perform extensive testing of GeoCloud across India to capture the regional, socio-economical and linguistic diversity of our country. Our evaluation data is sampled from 72 cities and 21 states from the delivery addresses of a large e-commerce platform in India. The results show a significant improvement in precision and recall over the state-of-the-art geocoding system for India, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our intuitive, robust and generic approach. While we have shown the effectiveness of the framework for Indian addresses, we believe the framework can be applied to other countries as well, particularly where addresses are unstructured. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of geocoding by learning reference-representations from large-scale delivery data.",,"Srivastava, Vishal and Tejaswin, Priyam and Dhakad, Lucky and Kumar, Mohit and Dani, Amar",2020,10.1145/3397536.3422254,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3397536.3422254,"Seattle, WA, USA",

Efficient Adaptive Convolutional Model Based on Label Embedding for Text Classification Using Low Resource Languages,"Text classification technology has been efficiently deployed in numerous organizational applications, including subject tagging, intent, event detection, spam filtering, and email routing. This also helps organizations streamline processes, enhance data-driven operations, and evaluate and analyze textual resources quickly and economically. This progress results from numerous studies on high-resource language-based text classification tasks. However, research in low-resource languages, including Ewe, Arabic, Filipino, and Kazakh, lags behind other high-resource languages like English. Also, the most difficult aspect of text classification using low-resource languages is identifying the optimal set of filters for its feature extraction. This is due to their complex morphology, linguistic diversity, multilingualism, and syntax. Studies that have explored these problems failed to efficiently use label information to better the performance of their methods. As a result, the label information for these languages needs to be adequately utilized to enhance classification results. To solve this problem, this study proposes an efficient adaptive convolutional model based on label embedding (EAdaCLE) to efficiently represent label information and utilize the learned label representations for various text classification tasks. EAdaCLE has adaptively engineered convolutional filters trained on inputs based on label embeddings generated in the same network as the text vectors. EAdaCLE ensures the adaptability of adaptive convolution and completely obtains label data as a supporting function to enhance the classification results. Extensive experiments indicate that our technique is more reliable than other methods on four low-resource public datasets.",,"Agbesi, Victor Kwaku and Wenyu, Chen and Ameneshewa, Abush S. and Odame, Emmanuel and Dumor, Koffi and Browne, Judith Ayekai",2023,10.1145/3596947.3596962,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3596947.3596962,"Virtual Event, Malaysia",
Deep Learning-Based Models for Classification of Invasive Plant Species from Hyperspectral Remotely Sensed Data,"Invasive plant species are plants, which spread extensively outside their native ecosystem. They pose a threat to the environment and economy at global and local scales, making effective mapping and detecting essential. This study aims to develop deep neural network-based classification models for hyperspectral data. The spectral reflectance of ten invasive plant leaves was collected using ASD FieldSpec4 standard Hi-Res device. Samples were collected from Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada university campus and Himayat Bagh garden in Aurangabad city, Maharashtra, India. Two types of deep neural networks (DNN) were applied: the first one is based on the one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN), and the second is based on the convolutional long short term memory (CNN-LSTM). We proposed and compare the performance of the two models with three existing models, multilayer perceptron (MLP), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM). The CNN-LSTM model achieves the highest discrimination accuracy among all the other models with an overall test accuracy of 99.3\% and an F1_score of 0.98.Moreover, the CNN model achieves a high classification accuracy of 97.3\% and an F1 score of 0.97, which contains the inception layer. In the CNN-LSTM model, the convolutional layer extracts the input vector of spectral features and feeds them to the LSTM layer to capture contextual information. In 1D CNN, the inception layer concatenates the output of multiple kernel sizes and adds flexibility to the model to improve the classification performance.

We first design and conduct a non-online pilot field experiment on approximately 22500 human subjects across India from 2014--2019, and collect data reflecting the impact of monetary incentives on these subjects to voluntarily trade their (personal) data in the digital surveillance age. Consequently, we study how various degrees of incentive influence subject preferences - both, when they are, or are not well-informed about the commercial malpractices their personal data might be subjected to. We analyze and rationalize two main observations in general for the Indian population: (i) despite being warned of the commercial malpractices associated with their personal data in the mobile and IoT age, they prefer to trade data for incentives, and (ii) the willingness of individuals to trade personal data is statistically heavy-tailed, and hints at following a weak power-law.",,"Pal, Ranjan and Light, Charles and Dong, Yifan and Liu, Mingyan and Wang, Yixuan and Ghosh, Pradipta and Nagubandi, Harshith and Golubchik, Leana and Nag, Bodhibrata and De, Swades",2022,,,"Phoenix, Arizona",
Shape-Enforcing Operators for Generic Point and Interval Estimators of Functions,"A common problem in econometrics, statistics, and machine learning is to estimate and make inference on functions that satisfy shape restrictions. For example, distribution functions are nondecreasing and range between zero and one, height growth charts are nondecreasing in age, and production functions are nondecreasing and quasi-concave in input quantities. We propose a method to enforce these restrictions ex post on generic unconstrained point and interval estimates of the target function by applying functional operators. The interval estimates could be either frequentist confidence bands or Bayesian credible regions. If an operator has reshaping, invariance, order-preserving, and distance-reducing properties, the shape-enforced point estimates are closer to the target function than the original point estimates and the shape-enforced interval estimates have greater coverage and shorter length than the original interval estimates. We show that these properties hold for six different operators that cover commonly used shape restrictions in practice: range, convexity, monotonicity, monotone convexity, quasi-convexity, and monotone quasi-convexity, with the latter two restrictions being of paramount importance. The main attractive property of the post-processing approach is that it works in conjunction with any generic initial point or interval estimate, obtained using any of parametric, semiparametric or nonparametric learning methods, including recent methods that are able to exploit either smoothness, sparsity, or other forms of structured parsimony of target functions. The post-processed point and interval estimates automatically inherit and provably improve these properties in finite samples, while also enforcing qualitative shape restrictions brought by scientific reasoning. We illustrate the results with two empirical applications to the estimation of a height growth chart for infants in India and a production function for chemical firms in China.",,"Chen, Xi and Chernozhukov, Victor and Fern\'{a}ndez-Val, Iv\'{a}n and Kostyshak, Scott and Luo, Ye",2021,,,,
PhonePeti: Exploring the Role of an Answering Machine System in a Community Radio Station in India,"Community Radio (CR) stations are short range radio stations that serve the local media needs of their surrounding communities. Community participation by way of helping set the station agenda, airing of people's voices, and providing them with a local communication medium, is the defining feature of CR. But this philosophy has been hard to execute in practice because of logistical difficulties, with station staff not being able to reach out to a listenership-base spread across several hundreds of square kilometers. In today's context though, the high penetration of mobile phones has made it easier for listeners to participate in the running of radio stations, but the potential of telephony and radio integration has been exploited only minimally.In this paper, we explore the use of PhonePeti, an automated answering machine system in a community radio station based in Gurgaon, India. Answering machines are one of several ways to bring together the radio and telephony mediums. We show that this alone has the potential to considerably improve community engagement, but it also opens up many interesting issues on usability. Through quantitative and content analysis of 758 calls from 411 callers over two iterations of PhonePeti, combined with telephonic interviews of several callers, we show that significant challenges arise in being able to explain the concept of an answering machine to people who have not been exposed to a similar system in the past. We then show, through call statistics, that PhonePeti has increased community engagement by enabling more listeners to reach the station. Finally, we show that an answering machine system can be used to collect useful information from the callers.",,"Koradia, Zahir and Seth, Aaditeshwar",2012,10.1145/2160673.2160708,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/2160673.2160708,"Atlanta, Georgia, USA",
Multi-GNSS Environment: Present and Future Opportunities for South-East Asia,"In the last decade, the world of Satellite Navigation has experienced an important change: while in late 90s the USA and Russia played a dominant role as only providers of global navigation satellite systems, the new century saw the arrival of new actors with projects for additional global and regional systems. Presently, many new systems are under development both global, such as Galileo from Europe and Compass/Beidou from China, and regional, such as RNSS from India and QZSS from Japan. Therefore, in the next few years all over the world, users will have the possibility to exploit the advantages deriving from the availability of a great number of satellites. This will happen in particular in South East Asian countries, where the highest number of satellites will be visible. However, the step from several stand-alone systems to the so-called Multi-GNSS environment is not simple neither straightforward. If, on the one side, several opportunities can come from the availability of many signals which are transmitted by satellites belonging to different systems, on the other side many technical issues arise. Nowadays, compatibility and interoperability are the hottest topics in the GNSS world: discussions on spectrum availability and allocation, signals characteristics, mutual interference, timescales and datum differences are on-going among system providers and international organizations such as ITU, etc.The talk will start with an extended overview of existing and planned Satellite Navigation Systems, both Global and Regional, describing their current status and their development or evolution plans. In the second part, the Multi-GNSS environment will be introduced, with a main focus on the situation in South East Asia.

RuralCafe: Web Search in the Rural Developing World,"The majority of people in rural developing regions do not have access to the World Wide Web. Traditional network connectivity technologies have proven to be prohibitively expensive in these areas. The emergence of new long-range wireless technologies provide hope for connecting these rural regions to the Internet. However, the network connectivity provided by these new solutions are by nature intermittent due to high network usage rates, frequent power-cuts and the use of delay tolerant links. Typical applications, especially interactive applications like web search, do not tolerate intermittent connectivity. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of RuralCafe, a system intended to support efficient web search over intermittent networks. RuralCafe enables users to perform web search asynchronously and find what they are looking for in one round of intermittency as opposed to multiple rounds of search/downloads. RuralCafe does this by providing an expanded search query interface which allows a user to specify additional query terms to maximize the utility of the results returned by a search query. Given knowledge of the limited available network resources, RuralCafe performs optimizations to prefetch pages to best satisfy a search query based on a user's search preferences. In addition, RuralCafe does not require modifications to the web browser, and can provide single round search results tailored to various types of networks and economic constraints. We have implemented and evaluated the effectiveness of RuralCafe using queries from logs made to a large search engine, queries made by users in an intermittent setting, and live queries from a small testbed deployment. We have also deployed a prototype of RuralCafe in Kerala, India.",,"Chen, Jay and Subramanian, Lakshminarayanan and Li, Jinyang",2009,10.1145/1526709.1526765,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/1526709.1526765,"Madrid, Spain",
Techno-Social Synergy for Disaster Resilience in Coastal Communities : A Sustainable Approach,"Disasters are inevitable for the coastal community due to their geographical closeness to the vast ocean. Sea-level rise, coastal floods, cyclones, hurricanes, tsunamis, and even high tides affect coastal communities across the globe. It leads to substantial economic loss and loss of human lives and properties, affecting the coastal communities’ livelihood and sustainability. Often the warning time and the preparation time to take action are relatively short. The community needs to be prepared to move to a safer location in this short duration. This work addresses the disaster risk reduction methods that need to be adopted by the coastal communities in India to reduce the impact of natural disasters and climate change risks they are susceptible. We propose an AI-based chatbot to provide accurate and up-to-date information about the spatiotemporally varying disaster scenarios and the vulnerability and resilience indexes. The AI-based chatbot will enhance the user experience and user safety by providing accurate information about disaster alerts through their smartphones.",,"Anand, Sruthy and Raj, Dhanesh and Sai, A.M.

Proportional Rate Reduction for TCP,"Packet losses increase latency for Web users. Fast recovery is a key mechanism for TCP to recover from packet losses. In this paper, we explore some of the weaknesses of the standard algorithm described in RFC 3517 and the non-standard algorithms implemented in Linux. We find that these algorithms deviate from their intended behavior in the real world due to the combined effect of short flows, application stalls, burst losses, acknowledgment (ACK) loss and reordering, and stretch ACKs. Linux suffers from excessive congestion window reductions while RFC 3517 transmits large bursts under high losses, both of which harm the rest of the flow and increase Web latency.Our primary contribution is a new design to control transmission in fast recovery called proportional rate reduction (PRR). PRR recovers from losses quickly, smoothly and accurately by pacing out retransmissions across received ACKs. In addition to PRR, we evaluate the TCP early retransmit (ER) algorithm which lowers the duplicate acknowledgment threshold for short transfers, and show that delaying early retransmissions for a short interval is effective in avoiding spurious retransmissions in the presence of a small degree of reordering. PRR and ER reduce the TCP latency of connections experiencing losses by 3-10\% depending on the response size. Based on our instrumentation on Google Web and YouTube servers in U.S. and India, we also present key statistics on the nature of TCP retransmissions.",,"Dukkipati, Nandita and Mathis, Matt and Cheng, Yuchung and Ghobadi, Monia",2011,10.1145/2068816.2068832,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/2068816.2068832,"Berlin, Germany",
SUI '16: Proceedings of the 2016 Symposium on Spatial User Interaction,"It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the fourth ACM Symposium on Spatial User Interaction. This event focuses on the user interface challenges that appear when users interact in the space where the flat, two-dimensional, digital world meets the volumetric, physical, three-dimensional (3D) space we live in. The symposium considers both spatial input as well as output, with an emphasis on the issues around the interaction between humans and systems. Due to the advances in 3D technologies, spatial interaction is now more relevant than ever. Powerful graphics engines and high-resolution screens are now ubiquitous in everyday devices, such as tablets and mobile phones. Moreover, new forms of input, such as multi-touch, finger and body tracking technologies are now easily available, and more and more commercial 3D systems with spatial interaction capabilities exist, many priced at the consumer level. However, the challenges, limitations, and advantages of leveraging this third dimension in human-computer interfaces are still not yet fully understood. These questions will only become more relevant as these emerging technologies continue to cross the barrier towards wide adoption.This year, SUI received 77 submissions, the highest number since its inception. Submissions came from numerous countries including Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Israel, Japan, Korea, Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, and the United States, making SUI a truly international conference. Reviews were conducted by a similarly international team of 25 program committee members, all experts in their respective areas of spatial UIs. Three submissions were reviewed by the program chairs and rejected outright without further review due to being off topic for SUI. All other submissions received at least four reviews, two by program committee members and two by external reviewers recruited by the program committee. We employed double-blind reviewing: only the program chairs and primary reviewers were aware of the identity of authors of submissions they reviewed. The review process yielded 20 accepted papers (13 full papers, and 7 short papers) for an overall acceptance rate of 26\% (or 25\% for full papers, 29\% for short papers). Five research demonstrations and 26 posters were also accepted for presentation at the Symposium. A unique feature of SUI 2016 is that the demonstrations will also be presented at the co-located ACM UIST 2016; furthermore, the five best SUI papers will also be presented as posters at UIST. Shahram Izadi (perceptiveIO Inc.) will deliver the Symposium keynote.",,,2016,,,"Tokyo, Japan",
"IndiaSat: A Pixel-Level Dataset for Land-Cover Classification on Three Satellite Systems - Landsat-7, Landsat-8, and Sentinel-2","Land-cover (LC) classification is required for land management and planning models, and is increasingly done through remote sensing data. Supervised machine learning methods applied to satellite imagery can help with high-resolution LC classification but demand a labeled dataset for training and evaluation of the models. The availability of such datasets is limited though, especially for developing regions like in India. We describe a large pixel-level dataset, IndiaSat, that we have curated and provided for open use, consisting of 180,414 pixels labeled into four LC classes: greenery, water bodies, barren land, and built-up area. Initial labels are obtained through the crowd-sourced mapping platform Open Street Maps (OSM), and then manually curated and corrected. We describe our data cleaning methodology and ensure spatial diversity across different geographic regions in the country. We show that the IndiaSat dataset can be used to train simple classifiers deployed on commodity platforms like Google Earth Engine (GEE) for three popular and openly accessible satellite systems: Landsat-7, Landsat-8, and Sentinel-2, with high accuracy, and to additionally build LC change detection models to determine pixel-level changes over a sequence of several years.",,"Bansal, Chahat and Ahlawat, Hari Om and Jain, Mayank and Prakash, Om and Mehta, Shivani A and Singh, Deepanshu and Baheti, Harshavardhansushil and Singh, Suyash and Seth, Aaditeshwar",2021,10.1145/3460112.3471953,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3460112.3471953,"Virtual Event, Australia",
Bartendr: A Practical Approach to Energy-Aware Cellular Data Scheduling,"Cellular radios consume more power and suffer reduced data rate when the signal is weak. According to our measurements, the communication energy per bit can be as much as 6x higher when the signal is weak than when it is strong. To realize energy savings, applications must preferentially communicate when the signal is strong, either by deferring non-urgent communication or by advancing anticipated communication to coincide with periods of strong signal. Allowing applications to perform such scheduling requires predicting signal strength, so that opportunities for energy-efficient communication can be anticipated. Furthermore, such prediction must be performed at little energy cost.In this paper, we make several contributions towards a practical system for energy-aware cellular data scheduling called Bartendr. First, we establish, via measurements, the relationship between signal strength and power consumption. Second, we show that location alone is not sufficient to predict signal strength and motivate the use of tracks to enable effective prediction. Finally, we develop energy-aware scheduling algorithms for different workloads - syncing and streaming - and evaluate these via simulation driven by traces obtained during actual drives, demonstrating energy savings of up to 60\%. Our experiments have been performed on four cellular networks across two large metropolitan areas, one in India and the other in the U.S.",,"Schulman, Aaron and Navda, Vishnu and Ramjee, Ramachandran and Spring, Neil and Deshpande, Pralhad and Grunewald, Calvin and Jain, Kamal and Padmanabhan, Venkata N.",2010,10.1145/1859995.1860006,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/1859995.1860006,"Chicago, Illinois, USA",
On the Formalization of Importance Measures Using HOL Theorem Proving,"Importance measures provide a systematic approach to scrutinize critical system components, which are extremely beneficial in making important decisions, such as prioritizing reliability improvement activities, identifying weak-links and effective usage of given resources. The importance measures are then in turn used to obtain a criticality value for each system component and to rank the components in descending manner. Simulations tools are generally used to perform importance measure based analysis, but they require expensive computations and thus they are not suitable for large systems. A more scalable approach is to utilize the importance measures to obtain all the necessary conditions by proving a generic relationship describing the relative importance between any pair of components in a system. In this paper, we propose to use higher-order-logic (HOL) theorem proving to verify such relationships and thus making sure that all the essential conditions are accompanied by the proven property. In particular, we formalize the commonly used importance measures, such as Birnbaum and Fussell-Vesely, and conduct a formal importance measure analysis of a railway signaling system at a Moroccan level crossing as an application for illustration purpose.",,"Ahmad, Waqar and Murtza, Shahid Ali and Hasan, Osman and Tahar, Sofi\`{e}ne",2019,10.1109/FormaliSE.2019.00021,https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1109/FormaliSE.2019.00021,"Montreal, Quebec, Canada",

BbmTTP: Beat-Based Parallel Simulated Annealing Algorithm on GPGPUs for the Mirrored Traveling Tournament Problem,"The problem of scheduling sports leagues has received considerable attention in recent years, especially since mathematically optimized schedules often have a large impact both economically and environmentally. The Mirrored Traveling Tournament Problem (mTTP) is an optimization problem that represents certain types of sports scheduling where the main objective is to minimize the total distance traveled by all the participating teams. In this paper, we propose a GPU based parallel simulated annealing algorithm for mTTP and test the available instances using NVIDIA's Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA). The approach taken here, especially keeping in mind the computationally intensive nature of mTTP, involves exploiting the thread level parallelism available in CUDA - where each thread starts with a random schedule from the discrete solution space and cooperate at regular intervals - called 'Beats' - to search for optimized solutions. Additionally, in this paper, we also introduce a new mTTP instance - IPL09 - which concerns with arriving at an optimized schedule for the Indian Premier League (IPL) - one of India's most popular sports league. Applying the proposed Beat Based algorithm for mirrored TTP (we call it as BbmTTP) to IPL09 we were successful in generating a schedule which reduced the total distance traveled by 30.20\%, or nearly 37,000 kilometres.",,"Jha, Saurabh and Menon, Vijay",2014,,,"Tampa, Florida",
