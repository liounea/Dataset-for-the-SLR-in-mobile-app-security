At the same time it has exposed the same people to security vulnerabilities of digital infrastructure. In this paper, we analyze 10 Android Digital Financial Services (DFS) applications using static analysis tools and present results to show that off-the-shelf static bug checking tools, can be useful in finding many critical security bugs in DFS applications. Our findings also show that DFS applications from developing countries have more vulnerabilities in application specific code compared with DFS applications from developed countries. However, we observe that general purpose static analysis tools have low specificity for DFS specific bugs, such as the vulnerabilities in the use of cryptography and networking, and there is a need to develop better bug detection tools.""""","""""Ibrar F,Saleem H,Castle S,Malik MZ""""","2017","10.1145/3136560.3136595","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3136560.3136595"
"""""Analysis of the Impact of Permissions on the Vulnerability of Mobile Applications""""","""""In this paper, we explored the potential risks of authorizations unexplained by benign apps in order to maintain the confidentiality and availability of personal data. More precisely, we focused on the mechanisms for managing risk permissions under Android to limit the impact of these permissions on vulnerability vectors. We analyzed a sample of forty (40) apps developed in Burkina Faso and identified abuses of dangerous authorizations in several apps in relation to their functional needs. We also discovered combinations of dangerous permissions because it exposes the confidentiality of the data. This analysis allowed us to establish a link between permissions and vulnerabilities, as a source of risk of data security. These risks facilitate exploits of privileges that should be reduced. We have therefore proposed the need to coordinate resolution mechanisms to the administrators, developers, users to better guide the required permissions by benign apps on Android.""""","""""Gouayon Koala; Didier Bassolé; Aminata Zerbo/Sabané; Tegawendé F.

In other words, what are the factors that influence users in their decisions to adopt and use a system or technology such as the MBanking app, and indirectly, what is the impact of this use on both the customers and financial inclusion? The research model developed relying on a combination of Technology Acceptance Model (TAM ), Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology ( UTAUT2 ), Information System Success Model ( ISSM ), and Protection Motivation Theory ( PMT ) and other constructs; it was then tested with a sample of 223 users of the “ SARA” M-Banking app of the financial institution called “ Afriland First Bank” . Findings revealed that: (1) utilitarian expectation, hedonic motivation, and status gain, habit, and perceived privacy concern have a significant influence on the intention to adopt M-Banking apps; and (2) the exploitative/explorative use of this technology has an impact on user’s loyalty and satisfaction but also contributes strongly to fostering financial inclusion in Cameroon.

"""""Forensic Analysis of Mobile Banking Apps""""","""""Over the years, the proliferation of mobile banking applications has been on the increase. Financial institutions are taking advantage of mobile technology to provide accessible, ubiquitous, user-friendly, convenient, and cost-effective services to their customers. The mobile banking applications access and process sensitive user data. As such, they are required to manage such data in a high secure manner and run in secure environment. This study conducts a forensic investigation of twelve popular Android m-banking apps in Nigeria to determine if the generated backups by the mobile OS do not save sensitive data; the application removes sensitive data from view when backgrounded; sensitive data are not held longer than necessary in the memory, with the memory cleared after use; minimum device access security policies are enforced by the app, and users are educated by the app about the type of PII processed and security best practices in using the app. Our findings revealed that while none of the apps saved sensitive data in generated backup, all except one held data of sensitive value in the memory of the test device and did not enforce any device access security policy. Also, none of the apps removed sensitive data when backgrounded. In addition to serving as a source of information for forensic investigators, we believe our study could assist mobile banking app developers in identifying aspects of the development process that need attention, which would lead to better secured apps.""""","""""Oluwafemi Osho; Uthman L.

"""""Let's Talk Money: Evaluating the Security Challenges of Mobile Money in the Developing World""""","""""Digital money drives modern economies, and the global adoption of mobile phones has enabled a wide range of digital financial services in the developing world. Where there is money, there must be security, yet prior work on mobile money has identified discouraging vulnerabilities in the current ecosystem. We begin by arguing that the situation is not as dire as it may seem---many reported issues can be resolved by security best practices and updated mobile software. To support this argument, we diagnose the problems from two directions: (1) a large-scale analysis of existing financial service products and (2) a series of interviews with 7 developers and designers in Africa and South America. We frame this assessment within a novel, systematic threat model. In our large-scale analysis, we evaluate 197 Android apps and take a deeper look at 71 products to assess specific organizational practices. We conclude that although attack vectors are present in many apps, service providers are generally making intentional, security-conscious decisions. The developer interviews support these findings, as most participants demonstrated technical competency and experience, and all worked within established organizations with regimented code review processes and dedicated security teams.""""","""""Castle S,Pervaiz F,Weld G,Roesner F,Anderson R""""","2016","10.1145/3001913.3001919","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3001913.3001919"
"""""Mo(Bile) Money, Mo(Bile) Problems: Analysis of Branchless Banking Applications""""","""""Mobile money, also known as branchless banking, leverages ubiquitous cellular networks to bring much-needed financial services to the unbanked in the developing world. These services are often deployed as smartphone apps, and although marketed as secure, these applications are often not regulated as strictly as traditional banks, leaving doubt about the truth of such claims. In this article, we evaluate these claims and perform the first in-depth measurement analysis of branchless banking applications. We first perform an automated analysis of all 46 known Android mobile money apps across the 246 known mobile money providers from 2015. We then perform a comprehensive manual teardown of the registration, login, and transaction procedures of a diverse 15% of these apps. We uncover pervasive vulnerabilities spanning botched certification validation, do-it-yourself cryptography, and other forms of information leakage that allow an attacker to impersonate legitimate users, modify transactions, and steal financial records. These findings show that the majority of these apps fail to provide the protections needed by financial services. In an expanded re-evaluation one year later, we find that these systems have only marginally improved their security. Additionally, we document our experiences working in this sector for future researchers and provide recommendations to improve the security of this critical ecosystem. Finally, through inspection of providers’ terms of service, we also discover that liability for these problems unfairly rests on the shoulders of the customer, threatening to erode trust in branchless banking and hinder efforts for global financial inclusion.""""","""""Reaves B,Bowers J,Scaife N,Bates A,Bhartiya A,Traynor P,Butler KR""""","2017","10.1145/3092368","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3092368"

"""""“Desperate Times Call for Desperate Measures”: User Concerns with Mobile Loan Apps in Kenya""""","""""The usage of mobile loan applications has proliferated in developing countries. This is due to the ease and speed in which they disburse small loans to users, compared to traditional financial institutions, such as banks, that only offer similar loans based on existing customer relationship or collateral. As mobile loan apps are a relatively new industry, these apps are mostly unregulated and therefore tend to charge extremely high interest rates. Further, they collect and sometimes misuse sensitive user data through the course of verifying customers and ensuring loan repayment, such as users’ contacts and SMS communications through the mobile device permission system. Yet, the reasons for usage as well as privacy concerns with these mobile loan apps in the developing world, and specifically in Kenya, remain largely unexplored. To investigate mobile loan apps, we conducted semi-structured interviews (n = 20) with loan app users in Kenya, and we find that most users generally have privacy concerns, particularly regarding access to their phones’ contacts. However, they often overlook these concerns as this outweighs their need to procure loans. At the same time, we find that users struggle to understand the use of permissions by these mobile loan apps (and mobile apps generally), confirming prior research on comprehension of Android permissions. Our results highlight privacy risks, concerns and behavior with the emerging mobile loan app marketplace in the developing world, and we offer recommendations that can help protect their users’ security and privacy, including the need for transparent communication by these apps on how they collect, use and secure their users’ data.""""","""""C.

However, privacy leakage through apps has increasingly become a major concern in Bangladesh, where the app collecting users' sensitive information without their consent was reported in news media for privacy violation. Our study with 32 participants from varying age, literacy level, and profession in Dhaka, Bangladesh unveils the perceptions of people around data collection and sharing by the app reported in privacy leakage news. All of our participants were aware of information leakage through the app they use, where they possess varying perceptions around providing personal information, like a sense of benefit, necessity and contribution, indifference, fear, or (no) authority over data collection. Our analysis reveals the relation between users' privacy perceptions, local infrastructure, and social practices in Bangladesh, where we identify the situated challenges that interfere with people's understanding of privacy notice. Our results lead to a discussion on how people's privacy perceptions are influenced by rapid urbanization and the opportunities offered by digitization in Bangladesh.

"""""Adoption of Covid-19 contact tracing app by extending UTAUT theory: Perceived disease threat as moderator""""","""""Objectives
Contact tracing applications are technological solutions that can quickly trace and notify users of their potential exposure to the Covid-19 virus and help contain the spread of the disease. However, extant research delineating the various factors predicting the adoption of contact tracing apps is scant. The study's primary objective is to develop and validate a research model based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), health belief model (HBM), perceived privacy risk and perceived security risk to understand the adoption of contact tracing application.
Methods
An online survey was carried out among users of the ‘Aarogya Setu’ contact tracing app in India. The partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) tool was employed to analyze data from 307 respondents.
Results
The results showed that performance expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions positively influenced users’ intention to adopt the app. In contrast, perceived privacy and security risks were significant barriers to app adoption. Perceived disease threat as a moderator mitigated the adverse impact of perceived privacy risk on users' intention to adopt contact tracing apps.
Conclusions
The current study gives insights on both drivers and barriers to the adoption of contract tracing applications. Various theoretical and practical implications of significance are provided for academicians and practitioners to effectively promote app adoption to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic.""""","""""Prasanta Kr Chopdar""""","2022","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hlpt.2022.100651","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211883722000594"
"""""Understanding digital contact tracing app continuance: Insights from India""""","""""Objectives
Digital contact tracing (DCT) was touted as an effective alternative to lockdown and other restrictive measures in controlling the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite considerable investments in research and development, the usage of DCT apps was found to be phenomenally low across the world. In this context, the current study investigates the factors influencing citizens’ continuance intentions to use the DCT app.
Methods
A theoretical framework was developed by extending the Expectation-confirmation model (ECM) of Information system continuance with Technology trust theory and a contextual factor perceived security and privacy to predict citizens’ continuance intentions to use the DCT app. The model was empirically tested using data from a field survey of 206 actual users of a DCT app implemented in India.
Results
The findings reveal that user satisfaction, trust in government, and trust in technology are significant predictors of citizens’ continuance intention. The model demonstrates high explanatory power by explaining 57.8% of the variance of continuance intention. It also validates the role of perceived security and privacy and trust in technology in determining user satisfaction.
Conclusion
The study makes a theoretical contribution by extending the ECM framework to predict DCT app continuance behavior. The insights from the study could be helpful for developers and policymakers in crafting strategies to improve the usage of DCT apps during future disease outbreaks.""""","""""Ashish Viswanath Prakash and Saini Das and K.

"""""On the MitM vulnerability in mobile banking applications for android devices""""","""""One of the primary concerns that the developers of mobile banking applications should strive to is to ensure the security of user information originating from any of these applications. However, implementing even basic security features, like performing encryption on user data or using HTTPS while connection establishment, on such mobile applications, is often found to be absent either due to the lack of knowledge of user security concerns, or unavailability of security testing experts who can point out the security flaws in the applications. In this paper, we consider man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack, a simple yet powerful attack, as a primary attack to test basic security features that a mobile banking application should impose. We have considered a total of 19 mobile banking applications on Android that are currently got deployed by public sector banks in India and are used by their respective customers. Surprisingly, the In about 90% of these banking applications, we have observed that the attack can be launched with ease even if the applications are using security protocols like HTTPS to establish a communication channel with their respective servers. Moreover, some mobile applications are using simple HTTP protocol to transfer user information without bothering anything about security. Hence, our analysis suggests that a level of revision is required to address the basic security flaws in the mobile banking applications to prevent even simple MitM attack.""""","""""S. Kaka; V. N.

"""""Integrating OAuth and Aadhaar with e-Health care System""""","""""Smartphone based E-health applications have the potential to change the way in which information is being exchanged between various stakeholders present in the medical industry by providing quick access to processed medical data on the go. E-health applications have gained wide acceptance among the doctor community because of their ability to help doctors in understanding the various pattern of symptoms that show up in the initial stages of a disease or during a relapse which in turn saves a lot of time and lives. These applications have also been used by a lot of patients to get instant access to their medical history which otherwise would have not have been possible with the traditional way of maintaining printed medical records in a file. Health records of a patient usually contain sensitive information and digitalization of these records will significantly increase the chances of private data falling into the wrong hands so it is very critical to provide secured access mechanisms to all the stakeholders present in this system and ensure users privacy. Medical data breach can be avoided by the implementation of various authentication and authorization techniques wherever necessary. Health care sector doesn't have a centralized way of identifying a patient and this decreases the feasibility of large scale storage and maintenance of the medical records provided by various doctors. Ever since the introduction of Aadhaar in India, all the major organizations have put in immense amount of effort to link various users accounts to their Aadhaar number and this has turned out to be very beneficial because it has reduced the processing time, reduced the leakage in the system and also eradicate the duplicity of account in sectors like LPG Subsidy, Academic Scholarship, Crop Insurance etc. Through this work, approaches involved in design and implementation of an Aadhaar based E Health application with OAuth is discussed.""""","""""A.

"""""Signature Based Malicious Behavior Detection in Android""""","""""User’s security and privacy are of increasing concern with the popularity of Android and its applications. Apps of malicious nature attempts to perform activities like information leakage and user profiling, detection of which is a challenge for security researchers. In this paper, we try to solve this problem by proposing a behavior based approach to detect malicious nature of applications in Android. Events and behavioral activities of an application are used to generate signature, which then is matched with signature database for detection. Behavioral signatures are designed on the basis of information leakage attempt, jailbreak attempt, abuse of root privilege and access of critical permissions. 260 popular apps of different nature were evaluated in addition to 42 android apps, which were flagged malicious by Government of India. The proposed system shows promising results to detect malicious behaviors. It also defines the nature of malicious activity exploited by an app.""""","""""Vikas Sihag; Ashawani Swami; Manu Vardhan; Pradeep Singh""""","2020","10.1007/978-981-15-6648-6_20","https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-15-6648-6_20"
"""""Mesh Messaging in Large-Scale Protests: Breaking Bridgefy""""","""""Mesh messaging applications allow users in relative proximity to communicate without the Internet. The most viable offering in this space, Bridgefy, has recently seen increased uptake in areas experiencing large-scale protests (Hong Kong, India, Iran, US, Zimbabwe, Belarus), suggesting its use in these protests. It is also being promoted as a communication tool for use in such situations by its developers and others. In this work, we report on a security analysis of Bridgefy. Our results show that Bridgefy, as analysed, permitted its users to be tracked, offered no authenticity, no effective confidentiality protections and lacked resilience against adversarially crafted messages. We verified these vulnerabilities by demonstrating a series of practical attacks on Bridgefy. Thus, if protesters relied on Bridgefy, an adversary could produce social graphs about them, read their messages, impersonate anyone to anyone and shut down the entire network with a single maliciously crafted message.""""","""""Martin R.

"""Forensic analysis of mobile banking applications in Nigeria""","""Advancement in mobile technology has made smart mobile devices to provide users with functionalities, which make these devices virtually indispensable in today's world. Mobile device users can now perform tasks that in past could only be performed on a personal computer. This is made possible by the variety of applications that run on these devices, from basic utility applications to social networking applications, health applications, and even mobile banking applications. Forensic analysis and security assessment of mobile banking applications in some countries have shown that sensitive user data such as login credentials and transactions details can be retrieved from the internal memory and cache of mobile devices. In this work, forensic acquisition and analysis of five mobile banking applications in Nigeria are performed, using the Universal Forensic Extraction Device (UFED) Touch and Forensic Recovery of Evidence Device (FRED). Analysis shows similar results with previous studies: the mobile banking applications did retain valuable user data, including user login credentials and transaction details. Security and privacy of user data need to be given higher priority by developers and proprietors of these applications.""","""Uduimoh AA,Ismaila I,Osho O,Abdulhamid SM""","2018","","https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Shafii-Abdulhamid/publication/333756475_Forensic_Analysis_of_Mobile_Banking_Applications_in_Nigeria/links/5d371c054585153e591a8e30/Forensic-Analysis-of-Mobile-Banking-Applications-in-Nigeria.pdf"
"""Security Analysis of Unified Payments Interface and Payment Apps in India""","""Since 2016, with a strong push from the Government of India, smartphone-based payment apps have become mainstream, with over $50 billion transacted through these apps in 2018. Many of these apps use a common infrastructure introduced by the Indian government, called the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), but there has been no security analysis of this critical piece of infrastructure that supports money transfers. This paper uses a principled methodology to do a detailed security analysis of the UPI protocol by reverse-engineering the design of this protocol through seven popular UPI apps. We discover previously-unreported multi-factor authentication design-level flaws in the UPI 1.0 specification that can lead to significant attacks when combined with an installed attacker-controlled application. In an extreme version of the attack, the flaws could allow a victim's bank account to be linked and emptied, even if a victim had never used a UPI app. The potential attacks were scalable and could be done remotely. We discuss our methodology and detail how we overcame challenges in reverse-engineering this unpublished application layer protocol, including that all UPI apps undergo a rigorous security review in India and are designed to resist analysis. The work resulted in several CVEs, and a key attack vector that we reported was later addressed in UPI 2.0.""","""Renuka Kumar and Sreesh Kishore and Hao Lu and Atul Prakash""","2020","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2018.04.017","https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity20/presentation/kumar"
