"""Security Assessment of Libyan Government Websites""","""Many governments organizations in Libya have started transferring traditional government services to e-government. These e-services will benefit a wide range of public. However, deployment of e-government bring many new security issues. Attackers would take advantages of vulnerabilities in these e-services and would conduct cyber attacks that would result in data loss, services interruptions, privacy loss, financial loss, and other significant loss. The number of vulnerabilities in e-services have increase due to the complexity of the e-services system, a lack of secure programming practices, miss-configuration of systems and web applications vulnerabilities, or not staying up-to-date with security patches. Unfortunately, there is a lack of study being done to assess the current security level of Libyan government websites. Therefore, this study aims to assess the current security of 16 Libyan government websites using penetration testing framework. In this assessment, no exploits were committed or tried on the websites. In penetration testing framework (pen test), there are four main phases: Reconnaissance, Scanning, Enumeration, Vulnerability Assessment and, SSL encryption evaluation. The aim of a security assessment is to discover vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. We also conducted a Content Analysis phase for all websites. In this phase, we searched for security and privacy policies implementation information on the government websites. The aim is to determine whether the websites are aware of current accepted standard for security and privacy. From our security assessment results of 16 Libyan government websites, we compared the websites based on the number of vulnerabilities found and the level of security policies. We only found 9 websites with high and medium vulnerabilities. Many of these vulnerabilities are due to outdated software and systems, miss-configuration of systems and not applying the latest security patches. These vulnerabilities could be used by cyber hackers to attack the systems and caused damages to the systems. Also, we found 5 websites didn't implement any SSL encryption for data transactions. Lastly, only 2 websites have published security and privacy policies on their websites. This seems to indicate that these websites were not concerned with current standard in security and privacy. Finally, we classify the 16 websites into 4 safety categories: highly unsafe, unsafe, somewhat unsafe and safe. We found only 1 website with a highly unsafe ranking. Based on our finding, we concluded that the security level of the Libyan government websites are adequate, but can be further improved. However, immediate actions need to be taken to mitigate possible cyber attacks by fixing the vulnerabilities and implementing SSL encryption. Also, the websites need to publish their security and privacy policy so the users could trust their websites.""",,"""A. A. Ali; M.

"""“Desperate Times Call for Desperate Measures”: User Concerns with Mobile Loan Apps in Kenya""","""The usage of mobile loan applications has proliferated in developing countries. This is due to the ease and speed in which they disburse small loans to users, compared to traditional financial institutions, such as banks, that only offer similar loans based on existing customer relationship or collateral. As mobile loan apps are a relatively new industry, these apps are mostly unregulated and therefore tend to charge extremely high interest rates. Further, they collect and sometimes misuse sensitive user data through the course of verifying customers and ensuring loan repayment, such as users’ contacts and SMS communications through the mobile device permission system. Yet, the reasons for usage as well as privacy concerns with these mobile loan apps in the developing world, and specifically in Kenya, remain largely unexplored. To investigate mobile loan apps, we conducted semi-structured interviews (n = 20) with loan app users in Kenya, and we find that most users generally have privacy concerns, particularly regarding access to their phones’ contacts. However, they often overlook these concerns as this outweighs their need to procure loans. At the same time, we find that users struggle to understand the use of permissions by these mobile loan apps (and mobile apps generally), confirming prior research on comprehension of Android permissions. Our results highlight privacy risks, concerns and behavior with the emerging mobile loan app marketplace in the developing world, and we offer recommendations that can help protect their users’ security and privacy, including the need for transparent communication by these apps on how they collect, use and secure their users’ data.""",,"""C.

"""Law Enforcement Access to Password Protected and/or Encrypted Mobile Data""","""The use of mobile phones in the commission of crime and terrorism pose serious investigative challenges to law enforcement agencies across the world. The discussion deals primarily with the extent a mobile phone service provider and/or or messaging applications provider and/or manufacturer must assist a law enforcement agency in gaining access to mobile data, specifically where the data is encrypted and/or password protected. It should be established whether a mobile phone service and/or applications provider and/or manufacturer must design security and/or privacy measures in such a way that law enforcement may gain access to the encrypted data. It may be argued that national security interests regarding the investigation of serious crimes such as kidnapping, child pornography, corruption and terrorism outweigh user privacy and user security. Terrorism affects all countries globally and in many instances result in the indiscriminate killing of a large number of people as illustrated by the Paris November 2015, the US December 2015, Abidjan, Ivory Coast, Brussels and Pakistan March 2016 killings. Although a law enforcement agency is pressurized to gather as much as possible evidence to investigate such heinous acts and prevent future attacks, the mobile phone evidence must be gathered within a legal framework that provides checks and balances to prevent the development of a police state resulting in the erosion or elimination of human rights. It is necessary to debate whether banning encryption and/or compelling a provider to have the technology to decrypt encrypted mobile communications or override password protected mobile data would serve as an investigative solution in the interest of national security or whether it would ultimately result in weakening user security and privacy to such an extent that all users around the world would be vulnerable to unlawful intrusions.""",,"""M.

"""Impact of COVID-19 on Information Technology Sector in Egypt""","""Pandemics raise huge challenges yet brought several opportunities. The sudden attack of COVID-19 revealed the importance of the information technology (IT) applications. The Reliance on the IT sector has become imperative to ensure sustainability and to raise most sectors' performance efficiency, especially the services' ones. This study applied PESTEL analysis to evaluate the current status of IT in Egypt. SWOT analysis was performed to explore points of strength, weakness, opportunities, and threats that face the IT sector in Egypt as a result of the COVID19 attack. The process of foreseeing the future, through non-officials' experts brainstorming, is the first step to design and implement strategic plans to achieve the targeted future. To exploit the future of the IT sector, the direct and indirect influences of the mentioned factors were studied with the use of the future wheel. An optimistic scenario is introduced to foresee the effects of the mentioned recommendations. The imperative of taking advantage of the opportunity to spread digital applications and to allow internet and digital services usage for all citizens is Egypt's gateway to reach international standards.""",,"""W.

"""A Comparative Study of User Data Security and Privacy in Native and Cross Platform Android Mobile Banking Applications""","""This research reports on security and privacy of user data transmitted in Android mobile banking applications. The basis of this approach was to experiment and urge a choice of development framework which ensures user data privacy in banking mobile applications of banks operating in Ghana. The results obtained directed attention to the fact that mobile banking applications developed using cross platform development frameworks (particularly Cordova) make applications less vulnerable by making use of most of the permissions requested ensuring user data privacy as compared to applications development using native development framework.""",,"""E.

"""Contribution of mobile messaging applications to improve citizen security""","""Mobile technologies are nowadays perceived as the most reliable technologies in the context of developing countries. Getting acquainted and trained, users may enhance their livelihoods by adopting new technological approaches. The main motivation for adopting new technologies evolved from their use in own environment by solving daily problems. Therefore, users need to be convinced that the technology will work in their best interests, for instance for controlling and improving security issues among a given population. As security issues are important, also in Cameroon, the evident existence of mobile devices all over the land even in remote villages without electricity and drivable roads, is something we shall rely on. The overall existing mobile infrastructure is an established precondition for building and creating local adapted mobile services. Stuck to their devices, how can mobile users efficiently contribute to enhance security in own locality? In this paper, we suggest a software architectural model for the development of a system for collecting and dispatching security data amount a giving population. The proposed model resulted from the analysis of existing messaging applications and a survey conducted in the city of Ngaoundere in Cameroun by interviewing 46 qualified mobile users.""",,"""P.

"""Statistical Insights and Fraud Techniques for Telecommunications Sector in Egypt""","""National Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (NTRA) has investigated the telecommunication performance in the service providers in Egypt between the periods of February 2018 till February 2019. Fraud is a multi-billions pounds' problem around the world. The problem is the huge financial loss of revenue that can affect the trustworthiness and performance of the telecommunication corporate. Egypt is one of the developing countries that are witnessing a rapid-growth development in its telecommunications infrastructure. As a result of the increment rate of corporate and internet users, fraudsters are exploiting the vulnerabilities to gain illegal revenue through the subscribers. The telecommunications sector in Egypt has suffered in the last two decades from different types of telecom fraud cases which have damaged the financial sector in both telecommunication side and governmental side. In this paper, we present: a) Statistical insights on users, mobile operators and Internet companies for the telecommunications sector in Egypt in 2018/2019. b) An illustration for the common fraudulent methodologies that are used against both users and telecom operators in Egypt. c) A discussion on the consequences of fraud cases with a suggested framework as a proactive methodology to prevent the escalated threat of telecom fraud.""",,"""A.

"""Towards Blockchain Services For Mobile Money Traceability And Federation""","""This paper discusses a new approach to mobile money, a money transfer solution via mobile phone, which uses accounts associated with SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) identifiers, and which are managed by the Mobile Network Operators (MNOs). The first solution launched in Kenya in 2007, M-PESA is one of the world major mobile money services. Mobile money becomes the new monopoly of MMOs in an economic system where the rate of unbanked adults is very high. Currently in 2019 Orange Money makes nearly 1.5 million transactions per day, which corresponds to a monetary value of nearly 15 billion CFA francs per day. The USSD is the technology at the heart of the Mobile-money transactions. Blockchain, which is the underlying technology of the first crypto currency Bitcoin, has drawn a lot of global attention in recent years. Blockchain does not stop seeing its field of action widen. The field of action of the Blockchain has not yet completed its enlargement. The rate of unbanked is still very high in developing countries; this rate is a factor that does not favor the emergence of the economy. It is necessary to count on the mobile money to skip this obstacle (according to the World Bank) we make here the state of the art on the mobile money and its underlying technologies in the sub-Saharan countries and in Burkina-Faso. We propose a mobile-money solution based on the Blockchain, in order to increase security, trust, and move towards a federation of mobile-money platforms.""",,"""K. E. AGBEZOUTSI; P. URIENe; T. M.

"""Promoting savings among low income earners in Kenya through mobile money""","""With most households in rural Kenya dependent on meagre wages from manual labor, the task of balancing immediate family needs with long-term financial goals is usually a difficult task, which in most cases leave families with minimal or no savings. This paper articulates a study to investigate the potential of using mobile money accounts as a money management platform that can help promote a savings culture as well as establish and nurture financial discipline among poor households in Kenya. Based on the premises that 41% of Kenyans do not save regularly because they do not have “enough money to live on let alone save for a rainy day”, the study examined innovative ways in which poor households could use mobile money accounts as a tool for financial inclusion, achieving household financial security, and enhancing family role performance. The study took place in Nairobi's Mathare slum. It aimed to understand, in depth, mobile money savings accounts usage among poor households. Key informants were low income traders, who earns a daily income of less than two dollars (about 200 Kenya Shillings). Data was collected using a questionnaire, informal conversations and contextual interviews and supplemented by in-depth interviews with managers from a leading mobile money service provider and the mobile money provider commercial banks. The study results indicates that lack of awareness on the available and affordable mobile money savings products, low interest rates on mobile money fixed deposit savings accounts and high transaction costs when making mobile money payments impacts negatively on mobile money fixed deposit savings accounts usage while availability of microcredit on mobile money savings accounts has a positive effect on the usage. The study provides policy and technology design recommendations that could aid in mobile money lock savings accounts acceptance.""",,"""P. K.

"""On Optimal Crowd-Sensing Task Management in Developing Countries""","""In developing countries, crop field productivity is particularly vulnerable to spreading diseases, including viruses and fungi. This is mostly due to the lack of skilled plant pathologists as well as to the scarce fund and poor infrastructure (e.g., roads, power and water lines) availability. The PlantVillage project through its mobile application named Nuru provides an AI digital assistant to recognize plants and their diseases through image analysis. Through the use of Nuru endowed smartphones, farmers can participate in a mobile crowd-sensing framework to improve their crop production. The crowd sensing framework also contributes to early detection of the outbreak of spreading diseases across geographical regions, and consequent adoption of appropriate countermeasures to ensure food security. As devices are often granted in a limited number by countries' government or charities, we propose a Farmer to Farmer (F2F) cooperation to achieve the required Quality of Information (QoI) for the system. In particular, only a selected crew of farmers receive smartphones to monitor their own farm as well as some other farmers' one. We formulate two variants of the problem of mobile device deployment and task assignment and propose related solutions. We evaluate the proposed approaches through simulations and apply them to a test-bed in Kenya.""",,"""A. Coletta; N. Bartolini; G. Maselli; D. P.

"""Rebuilding the Internet Exchange Point in Uganda""","""Uganda is a land locked country in South East Africa. It is separated from the Indian ocean by Kenya to the east and Tanzania to the south. It is separated from South Atlantic by the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west. Uganda's connection to the Internet is overland to Mombasa, Kenya where the Seacom cable installed in 2009 connected Mombasa to Europe with a capacity of 640 Gb/s and the World Bank funded Eastern Africa Submarine Cable System (EASSy) undersea fibre optic cable connects Eastern Africa to South Africa and Europe with a capacity of 1.4 Tb/s. [1]. Additionally until recently Uganda was dependent upon a single overland link to Kenya via Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Limited (UETCL) power lines whereas today there are a number of options such as the Seacom cable fibre cable completed in 2015. During the 2010 FIFA World Cup Final a terrorist attack on the Kyandondo Rugby Club in Nakawa, Kampala brought all Internet Service Providers (ISP) in Uganda off-line as the rugby ground sits directly underneath the UETCL power lines bring Internet services from Kenya. This leaves Uganda at significant disadvantage regionally and to-date the technology industry has tended to converge at Mombassa and Nairobi as well as in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Recently however as the modern Internet services require Global Service Providers (GSP) to get closer to the end-user so they can avail of lower latency, higher bandwidth applications, the justification for serving all of South East Africa from data centres in Narobi, Mombassa, Dar es Salaam and even from South Africa is becoming less valid. In order to facilitate the deployment of locally hosted content and reduce the country's reliance on international cables, additional capacity was required at the country's primary local interconnection point, the Uganda Internet Exchange Point (UIXP). UIXP is currently developing its infrastructure to support a larger membership encompassing growing demand from both ISPs and Application Service Providers (ASP). This paper serves to outline the developments that are being put in place to take UIXP from a local Internet eXchange Point (IXP) supporting local ISPs and e-government services to the next level where it is in a position to support GSP Content Delivery Networks (CDN) and therefore pave the way for the next phase of development of the Internet in Uganda.""",,"""D.

"""Promoting e-participation in County Governments: A case of a county government in a developing country""","""Public participation is considered an important pillar in governance in Kenya as demonstrated by the way it has been severally enshrined in the constitution of Kenya 2010 as well as the County Governments Acts. Despite such policy and regulatory frameworks for public participation being in place, county governments in Kenya are still characterized by poor public participation in governance and government processes. Additionally, despite several studies demonstrating that information technology (IT) is a critical enabler of public participation, not much is known on how county governments in Kenya are harnessing the power of technology for public participation. This research attempts to understand how IT is being used for public participation, and the current challenges associated with its application in the promotion of public participation in county governments in Kenya. This paper, presents the initial findings from one of the counties. The study used interviews with both junior and senior county officials. Additionally, county documents as well as information from county websites and social media platforms were used. The study findings have revealed that the use of IT was gaining prominence in county engagements with the public, more specifically, the use of social media. However, it would appear that civic participation through these platforms was minimal. Additionally, the county strategic documents reveal that e-participation is yet to be appreciated as a strategic factor in increasing and enriching public participation in county governance. Several challenges were also identified and these are presented in this paper. It was thus hoped that these findings would enable an increasing understanding of the prevailing local circumstances which inhibit e-participation within county governments. The findings have practical implications on how county governments in Kenya (and possibly other developing countries) may better position themselves to exploit technology for improved public participation.""",,"""J.

"""Model For Mitigating Smishing Attacks On Mobile Platforms""","""Cybercrime has increased as a result of technology improvements and people's increasing reliance on smartphones and other technologies. SMS enables the dissemination of critical information, which is especially significant for non-digital savvy users who are typically the most isolated. Smishing, often known as SMS phishing, is the practice of sending phony text messages to trick someone into divulging personal information or installing malware. In Kenya, smishing crimes have been noted to escalate at a higher rate. However, there is no comprehensive investigation that has been done involving smishing attacks. There are various proposed solutions for mitigating smishing attacks. However, no existing solution authenticates the sender, filters the smishing content from the message, and informs the user of the potentially harmful content. Therefore, this study presents a novel method to authenticate the sender, filter smishing content from the message, and informs the user in case potentially harmful content exists in the message. Python, MYSQL, and Naïve Bayes classifier were used to develop the model. The model will help mobile phone users to identify fraudulent messages sent by smishers quickly and effectively.""",,"""D.

"""Operational coastal map re-actualization by RADAR SAR images, examples in French Guiana, Mauritania and Cameroon""","""The French Hydrographic Office has to publish information for navigation security in its responsible zones (French territories, West African coasts (with agreements between these countries and France), Djibouti, Viet-Nam, etc.). Nautical charts on African coasts are old and had often been established in the 1950s. Local geodetic reference systems used are not well known, so maps are not in accordance with GPS navigation. In French Guiana, coastal evolution is so important that nautical charts are obsolete. Sedimentation and erosion of mangrovia vegetation can reach one kilometre per year. We study the contribution of RADAR SAR imagery for nautical chart updates. Our interests are coastline, interidal zone delimitation, harbour structures and bathymetry (<20 metres). We present solutions for different problems. First, for cartographic applications, we reference geographically our ERS images in a global geodetic reference system without ground points, we use precise orbitographic products, differences between geoid and global ellipsoid and ERS annotation files: precision estimation of this step was made by GPS measurements and also comparison between images acquired in ascending and descending mode. Second, ground interpretations permit first in Mauritania and French Guiana to follow coastal evolution and particularly coastline erosion and flood risk zones, and last in Cameroon to understand high and low vegetation distribution in mangrovia and in Wouri estuary, to follow sand banks which obstruct the Douala city channel. We propose a methodology for ERS RADAR SAR use including interferometry, the speckle reduction process and automatic detection tools. Third, we present new coastal cartographic documents for regions with strong changes and a low map update frequency.""",,"""H. Trebossen; J. P. Rudant; N. Classeau; B. Fruneau; M. F. Courel; N.

"""University — Industry networking for training, research, and employment- HTI experience""","""In 1988, The Higher Technological Institute (HTI) was established in the new industrial city called ""The Tenth of Ramadan City"". HTI is the first private university level Institute for Engineering Education in Egypt. One of its main missions is to build a strong and sustainable link with industry especially in the local community. From day one, the main elements of this link were clear and accordingly efforts have been spent to build and strengthen such elements in the following main directions: - Development of industry linked educational programs. - Students internships and Employment. - Specialized courses for engineers and technicians in industry. - Problem solving for industry - Research & Development. The results of applications of this link proved that there are mutual benefits for both the institute and industry. In industry, the gain is clear in the suitability and reduced cost of the technical services introduced while for HTI, the gain can be seen in practical experience of the students which they gain through four yearly 12- week industrial training semesters. This, in addition to other factors, helps very much for employment of the graduates which in turn increases the number of new students joining the institute. In spite of the fact that these efforts have fruitful results in the first three directions (Industry linked educational programs, Internships & tailored courses for industry), still much work is needed to enrich and improve the cooperation in solving the industry problems and initiate serious research and development based on university -industry cooperation. This relative weakness may be due to the fact that HTI efforts were carried out on an individual bases. Accordingly, establishing National University -Industry Network in Egypt is necessary not only to improve and strengthen the weak points but also to guarantee the sustainability of such successful link through synergistic integration of the capabilities of both parties: industry & university. In this paper, HTI experience in cooperation with industry through about 25 years will be highlighted. The experience with two international projects related to university/industry link (The first is European/Egyptian and the second is European/Egyptian/Jordanian TEMPUS projects) will be also briefly shown.

"""Application of RADAR Corner Reflectors for the Detection of Small Vessels in Synthetic Aperture Radar""","""Detection of vessels from space-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is an important area of research with many applications, including fisheries monitoring, counter-piracy, and maritime border security. The detection of vessels on the ocean surface in SAR imagery requires that the vessel has sufficiently high radar cross section (RCS). In general, the RCS of an object is a function of the object's material, size, and shape, as well as RADAR parameters such as center frequency. Even, two objects of the same size may have different RCSs based on construction materials (i.e., wood versus metal). In Ghana, as in much of the Gulf of Guinea, wooden canoes 6-25 m in length represent a significant percentage of maritime traffic. These canoes are not easy to detect and track in coastal RADAR, nor are they easily detected in SAR imagery. These vessels may represent a significant risk to maritime safety and security. Here, we describe one possible solution for the problem described-above based on inexpensive, versatile corner reflectors with high RCS. Specifically, we describe the design and construction of high RCS corner reflectors and results from a series of experiments in which corner reflectors were installed on wooden canoes. During the experiments, canoes were deployed to specific locations off the coast of Ghana at specific times, corresponding to the acquisition of space-based SAR imagery. We present results from these experiments, which indicate that wooden canoes with these corner reflectors can be detected in space-based SAR imagery.""",,"""J. Stastny; S. Cheung; G. Wiafe; K.

"""Framework for the Provision of User Felt Protected Mobile Banking Services""","""The proliferation of mobile devices is a direct sector, which has become the primary means by which individuals complete the vast majority of their daily tasks. Financial institutions are bolstering their expansion plans by emphasizing mobile banking and financial services. However, there are several security issues with mobile banking due to the expanding capabilities of mobile technology. That's why banks need a system to evaluate the safety of their mobile banking services. The cyber-security barriers to mobile banking encountered by SACCOs in Kenya were identified using a survey study methodology, and the strategies used by SACCOs to mitigate the effects of these problems on the supply of mobile banking services were assessed. The research uncovered the risks associated with mobile banking in terms of cyber security. This analysis also assessed the measures taken by SACCOs to guarantee the provision of a safe mobile banking service in the eyes of their customers. The results informed the development of a framework for the provision of mobile banking services that prioritizes customers' sense of safety. After putting the suggested structure through its paces with the help of specialists, it was proven to be quite trustworthy.

Pantanal is an expert system model based on three kinds of input data : I) monthly meteorological data contains average values of climate variables such as mean temperature, maximum and minimum rainfall, number of days of rain and humidity, for a consecutive period of 44 years, collected from the station of El- Fayoum; II) soil survey data collected from 46 soil profiles representative of the study area and stored in the MicroLEIS SDBm plus database; and III) agricultural information on soil use and management for major crops in the area, from scientific publications of the Ministry of Agriculture. The model application results are grouped in five vulnerability classes: V1-none, V2-low, V3-moderate, V4-high and V5-Extreme for each specific contaminant. Results obtained in El-Fayoum area show that 2.8%, 45.2% and 52% of total studied area were classified as V1, V3, and V4 vulnerable land due to phosphorous contamination. On the other hand 95.9 % and 4.1% of total studied area were classified as V3, and V4 vulnerable land due to nitrogen and heavy metals, and 6.1 %, 21.5 %, 68.8 % and 2.8% of total studied area were classified as V1, V2, V3, and V4 vulnerable land due to pesticides. Additionally, Typic Torripasamment soil has a high vulnerability classes for all the types of contaminants although it represents a residual area, of 2600 ha approximately. Finally hypothetical recommended scenarios were established for each soil types in order to formulate sustainable agriculture practices by reducing inputs use like water, fertilizers and pesticides, and so minimizing the risk of soil degradation due to contamination. In conclusion, MicroLEIS DSS appears to be a useful tool in this part of arid regions, such as north of Africa (Egypt), to formulate sustaining agro-ecological systems. Although information about land resources in this part of Africa is rather scarce, these innovative agro-ecological strategies can be applied and adapted in other agricultural provinces from the Arab Republic of Egypt in order to achieve a regional sustainable land management.""",,"""S.

"""A Survey of Undergraduate Project Topics in Computer Science at the University of Botswana""","""Model curricula such as ACM/IEEE recommend that characteristics of students graduating in Computer Science should include project experience. In line with these recommendations, students in their fourth year of undergraduate study in the Computer Science department at the University of Botswana have to complete a major project as part of fulfilling the requirements for the award of a degree. The project gives students the opportunity to implement some of the theories and techniques learnt during the course of their programme of study. Students` choice of project topics therefore heavily depends on what the curriculum offers in terms of diversity of course content and techniques taught. This paper presents an analysis of 154 students' projects in the Computer Science department at the University of Botswana for the period 2013-2016 with a particular focus on the topic trends and issues of diversity and relevance to both the local and international context. The topics' list is categorized using the Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering method. The analysis of titles and abstracts shows an inclination towards web-based systems and mobile applications that are relevant to the local context. Also, the titles and abstracts do not reveal core Computer Science areas such as algorithms, machine learning and security. Trending topics in Computing, which are also typically done as project topics, also seem not to feature. To reveal an effective categorization and assess comparability to international trends the rest of entire project document (body) needs to be analysed.""",,"""G. Mosweunyane; N. P. Motlogelwa; G.

"""R U There? Cell Phones, Participatory Design, and Intercultural Dialogue""","""Background: This case recounts my experiences during a four-year participatory design project with colleagues in Katanga Province of the Democratic Republic of Congo, where I attempted to develop a system for people working in rural areas to share business information via mobile phones. Research questions: For the first phase of this project: How do businesspeople in Katanga Province use their cell phones to support their business operations? How do they want to use these phones in their businesses? How do their use and attitudes compare with those of graduate students at a Midwestern US university? For the second phase of this project: Can a cell-phone delivered information system be designed for artisanal miners and small farmers in Katanga Province to share local pricing information for copper, cobalt, and maize? Situating the case: Researchers in participatory design for social and/or technological change have traditionally assumed that including users in early design phases will result in democratization of project outcomes. When these participatory design projects are situated in intercultural settings, however, they are complicated by political and economic conditions, as well as differences in values and social relations. Because participatory design relies on dialogue within robust, multimodal communication networks, weaknesses in this approach arise when trusted social relations are not in place upon which to build these multimodal communication networks. Cases of participatory design between colleagues in the US and Sub-Saharan Africa illustrate profound effects of political and economic inequities on participatory design projects. Methodology: This is an experience report of a project that developed initially from a classroom project in which my students in the US conducted a communication audit for a partner based in Katanga Province in the Democratic Republic of Congo. A US-based nongovernmental organization (NGO) arranged the partnership and I later went to the field to carry out this project. About the case: Working with an NGO while based exclusively in the US, we attempted to develop a system from which people working in rural areas could share business information, such as reporting business conditions in a rural location back to the NGO's Lubumbashi headquarters 75 km away, via mobile phones. The project did not work because people in Katanga were not familiar with the information design issues involved in the system and I was not familiar with the actual business situation at the NGO in Katanga. To address these issues, I traveled to the Democratic Republic of Congo and interviewed NGO staff and clients. But my presence in the NGO's Lubumbashi headquarters created irreparable social disruption. I continued the project with a new client in Katanga and revised goals for the information-sharing system, but that system, too, did not work for lack of a trusted social network of informants to participate in the information-sharing system. In the end, I was only able to complete an initial analysis of the needs. Conclusions: Despite the need to abandon the project, this case raised these questions about participatory design for information and communication technologies (ICT) projects when collaborators do not “speak the same language:” How can communication researchers effectively build trusted relationships with colleagues in developing nations in order to facilitate successful participatory design projects? Given the research obligations and reward structures at US universities, is it feasible for communication researchers to spend the time to build trusted relationships with colleagues in developing nations, which may not yield publishable research or quantifiable results for three years or more? Given the political and social conditions in many developing areas, can communication researchers rely on the stable conditions and personal relations that are necessary to conduct participatory design for ICT projects?""",,"""B.

"""Upper mantle shear wave velocity structure beneath the East African plateau: evidence for a deep, plateauwide low velocity anomaly""","""The shear wave velocity structure of the upper mantle beneath the East African plateau has been investigated using teleseismic surface waves recorded on new broadband seismic stations deployed in Uganda and Tanzania, as well as on previously deployed stations in Tanzania and Kenya. Rayleigh wave phase velocities at periods between 20 and 182 s, measured with a two-plane wave method, have been used to create phase velocity maps, and dispersion curves extracted from the maps have been inverted to obtain a quasi-3-D shear wave velocity model of the upper mantle. We find that phase velocities beneath the Tanzania Craton and areas directly north and west of the craton are faster, at all periods, than those beneath the Western and Eastern branches of the East African Rift System. At periods <50 s, the western branch is slower than the Eastern Branch, but at periods greater than 50 s, this relationship is reversed. Anisotropy is found at all periods, with a generally north-south fast polarization direction. The shear wave velocity model shows a seismically fast lithosphere (lid) beneath the Tanzania Craton to depths between 150 and 200 km. The fast velocities in this depth range extend to the north beneath the Uganda Basement Complex and to the east beneath the northern Tanzania divergence zone, indicating that these regions together form a rigid block around which rifting has occurred within weaker mobile belt lithosphere. The Eastern and Western branches are slower than the craton at lithospheric mantle depths, and both branches show variable structure in the upper 200 km of the mantle, with the lowest velocities found beneath areas of Cenozoic volcanism. At depths greater than ~225 km, a low velocity anomaly is present beneath the entire East African plateau that may extend into the mantle transition zone. Velocities in the low velocity region are reduced by ≥ 10 per cent relative to lid velocities, and if attributed only to temperature variations, would represent an unrealistic thermal perturbation of >400 K. Consequently, it is likely that the velocity reduction reflects a combination of thermal and compositional changes, and also possibly the presence of partial melt. The width and thickness of the low velocity anomaly is greater than typically expected for a plume head and is more easily attributed to an upward continuation of the lower mantle African superplume structure into the upper mantle.""",,"""A.

"""Investigate Risk Factors and Predict Neonatal and Infant Mortality Based on Maternal Determinants using Homogenous Ensemble Methods""","""Ethiopia, one of the Sub-Saharan countries, has been affected by preventable and treatable causes of childhood mortality. According to the Ethiopia Mini Demographic and Health Survey (EMDHS) 2019, the child mortality rate, which measures under-five child deaths per one thousand children, was 43 during the 5 years preceding the survey. This study, hence, aims to investigate risk factors and predict neonatal and infant mortality based on maternal data. To this end, data was collected from the Ethiopia Demographic and Health Surveys (EDHS) and several experiments were conducted using homogenous ensemble methods to develop a model that best identifies risk factors and predicts neonatal and infant mortality in Ethiopia. A decision tree with bagging and AdaBoost achieved an accuracy of 94.34% and 94.79% and area under ROC of 86% and 87% respectively. Naïve Bayes achieved 87.60% and 89.5% with bagging and AdaBoost. A decision tree with AdaBoost ensemble method performed better with 97.19% and 99.92% F-measure and recall, respectively. A maximum increase of 4 % accuracy for weak classifiers was achieved with the ensemble classification. As the finding suggest the interventions towards neonatal and infant mortality may need to take the factors related to maternal determinants into account. The application of heterogeneous ensemble methods is similar challenges may enhance the performance of the prediction model.""",,"""T. Dereje; T. M. Abuhay; A. Letta; M.

"""A simple integrated smart green home design""","""Smart home systems were introduced to autonomously control appliances, lights and other services based on the current state inside homes. Smart home systems are designed for a wide band of applications such as healthcare, power management, safety and security. In Egypt, we are suffering from an electrical power shortage because the production is not sufficient for the actual consumption. In addition, there are some isolated areas not covered by the National Grid. Because of this persisting challenge, the need for finding solutions arose. Egypt is a developing country with limited resources, consequently economic and power saving focused solutions are needed. In this paper, a simple integrated design of a smart green house is introduced as a solution for a common Egyptian home to save the consumed power from the National Grid. This design has two main pillars: First, a smart system that controls the power consumption through monitoring the activity in the home to save the power as much as possible. This system comprises of a wireless network of controllers. Each controller monitors and controls a specific area considered a separate zone. These zone controllers exchange the current data and control parameters with a master unit, which provides supervision and control of the entire system. In addition, the system can be monitored and configured locally through a wall mounted touch screen or remotely using a mobile phone or web interface. Second, a solar power supply system equipped with a two degree of freedom sun tracker to partially or fully power the loads and hence reduces the power consumption from the National Grid. The solar system is integrated with the smart supervision system through a wireless link to the master unit.""",,"""A. D. Asham; M. Hanaa; B. Alyoubi; A. M. Badawood; I.

"""Distribution automation (DA) using supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) with advanced metering infrastructure (AMI)""","""In Ghana, power generation, transmission and distribution are the preserve of utility companies like Volta River Authority (VRA), Ghana Grid Company (GRIDCo) and Electricity Company Ghana (ECG) respectively. The Northern Electricity Department also distributes electric power in the three northern regions and parts of the Brong Ahafo Region. In the transmission system, GRIDCo uses Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) to monitor and control switches and protective devices. ECG also runs part of its system, from the bulk supply point to the feeders feeding the distribution transformers, with SCADA. Unfortunately, there is no SCADA application from the distribution transformer to the consumer end. This paper proposes a SCADA-based Distribution Automation (DA) of utility metering. The findings of the research show that, using DA with Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) solves problems associated with the demerits of the present method of billing.

"""Automated Railway Security System""","""Being faster, larger and more reliable, today's trains have permeated the other means of transportation as the prime mode between several countries. However, railroad-related ac-cidents are also more perilous in damage and loss of lives. Therefore, in common railway security systems, more strivings are required for strengthening the safety. Moreover, manual observing of the tracks is actually impracticable and unreliable. Thus, to avoid collisions and allow a better communication between train, central control headquarters, and passengers, this paper, being focused in establishing an automated railway security prototype model using advanced electronic circuits, a communication module, and the proposed mobile interfaces. It is established on an Arduino UNO embedded platform to introduce automatic control crossing gates, switching train tracks and detecting line cracks with the aid of electronic sensors like IR sharp sensor, ultrasonic sensor, and gyroscopes. Moreover, by employing the web camera, the operator of the control room could get real status updating and have a continuous behavior monitoring during the train journey. Thus, the railway gate could be highly controlled so the road traffic will be wholly prophesied. Especially on dangerous trips, the train is supported by the developed dummy car which can detect and monitor any causes of risks on the railway lines and send that fault to the concerned authority. To offer different services for drivers and passengers, the proposed Android applications are responsible for obtaining the sensed data through the Bluetooth module and broadcasting urgent data to the control room. As the accuracy of automated operations is usually more accurate than manual operations, fatal errors due to human mistakes could be easily limited. Thus, compared to related systems, the proposed automatic railway security system which is cost-effective will be robust enough to facilitate much safety standards to Egypt railways.""",,"""M. M.

"""Acacia Tortilis Encroacher Bush as a Bioenergy Source""","""Invasive and encroaching (IE) species have posed a threat to biodiversity in ecosystems, rangeland productivity, groundwater generation, the environment and economy in savannah ecosystems like Botswana and Namibia. While de-bushing of large diameter stocks have yielded huge economic returns for countries like Namibia through a lucrative charcoal and fuelwood or chips, smaller diameter ones have little economic value, especially the shrubs that encroach space in cities and towns. The goal of this study is to explore possible means of deriving economic value from the encroachers, which are currently disadvantaging Botswana through reduced rangeland productivity and de-bushing costs. Pyrolysis has received attention as a potentially low cost thermochemical method that can efficiently utilize such lignocellulosic residues. The primary goal is to use the bio-oil in stationary engine applications for power generation, especially in remote areas of sparsely populated Botswana, where it has been deemed uneconomic to connect them to the national grid. Characterization of encroacher bush indicated it could be a good feedstock for pyrolytic conversion due to the relatively high volatile matter (76.51 %), moderately low ash content (3.90%) and high gross calorific value (17.3 MJ/kg). The A. tortilis was then pyrolyzed under varying overall and condenser temperatures to establish the optimum operating parameters. The obtained bio-oil was characterized, comparing its properties to conventional fuels. The optimum pyrolysis temperature was found at 550°C, while the optimum primary condenser temperature, with the best quality oil (36.809MJ/kg), was at 125°C. The viscosity of this oil was estimated to be 24.024 mPa.s using the other characterized samples. Gas chromatography was also carried out on the oil samples and the compounds with the highest mass presence were catalogued. It is concluded that the bio-oil could be used in moderate-slow engines with moderate upgrading, while it needs to be diluted with a solvent then blended with a diesel for use in fast diesel engines. It is also important to establish the particulate composition and flash point of the bio-oil, though these tests were not carried out in this study.""",,"""G. Charis; G. Danha; E. Muzenda; N. P.

"""Computer Science Education in Angola: The Key Challenges""","""The increasing adoption of technology in the classroom offers several advantages, but also challenges all stakeholders, including instructors, students and decision makers. E-learning has gained momentum, especially in the last two years with the onset of the pandemic, forcing lectures to migrate to the internet and requiring new methodologies to support knowledge transfer between instructors and students. Thus, to verify the situation of Angola in relation to practices and methodologies related to the teaching of informatics, we search to identify existing practices through the application of a questionnaire to teachers of informatics subjects in secondary schools, colleges, and universities of the country. This study aims to discover the effects of using technology as a support for teaching computer science classes, including software engineering, programming, and computer networks. Therefore, 82 participants were involved in this study answering an online survey. Results shown that, although digital technologies are revolutionizing the world and consequently education, institutions in Angola still face several challenges, such as, lack of laboratories for practical classes, lack of electricity, lack of internet, and lack of computers for students. In addition, the adoption of technologies in the classroom proved ineffective, perhaps because of the absence of determining factors for technological inclusion by the institutions, or even because of the training of teachers in the area, whether weak, inefficient, or incomplete. In this sense, although the use of software in the classroom facilitates the acquisition of knowledge, there are still several barriers to be overcome for this to happen broadly.

"""Recurrent Neural Network-based Base Transceiver Station Power Supply System Failure Prediction""","""In mobile telecom networks, Base Transceiver Station (BTS) is a key infrastructure that connects customers with the mobile network. BTSs are geographically scattered across the networks service area and thousands of fault indicating alarms are generated by a typical BTS on a daily basis. Thus, proactively maintaining the BTS before faults happen is beneficial to guarantee proper operation of the network and reduce operational costs. In the mobile networks installed in the city of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, failure in power supply system of BTSs takes the biggest share for mobile services interruption. This work investigates the early prediction of BTS failures due to power system and environmental abnormalities using recurrent neural networks (RNN) with long short term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU) cells. Eleven power-supply system related features and alarms were collected from a real-time power and environmental monitoring system installed in each BTS. Moreover, the experiments were performed on five BTS sites with sixteen weeks of observations. The experimental results show that GRU using sigmoid activation function with feature reduction achieves better performance than using LSTM with the different configurations investigated. Unlike the prevailing practice in the network operator, which is taking corrective actions in response to alarms, the results in this experimental provide a new insight to the mobile operator to exploit patterns inherent in the daily measured data and predict the well-being of its infrastructure.""",,"""Y.

From education to business, all sectors of peoples’ lives have been affected. An arising issue from the current situation is the tracking and managing of COVID-19 related data. With the resumption of educational institutions in Kenya, adherence to protocols provided by the ministry of education is paramount. One of the guidelines provided for the resumption of schools is thermal monitoring/screening of people, which has been implemented differently across the country. Some universities have opted for checking students’ temperatures and not keeping a record of this information. Others require students to go through a check-up to give their details, and their temperature is recorded. The flaw with this system is inadequate record-keeping as the records are manual, which leads to a hectic analysis. The research aimed to find a solution to better manage and analyse COVID-19 data. The solution was implemented using IoT technology and AI, where a camera and a temperature sensor was used to record the temperature and identify the students.

"""Optical Potential Mapping of the Excitation Process in the Field stimulated Guinea pig Papillary Muscle using short Pulses""","""We have performed optical potential mapping in guinea pig papillary muscles during the application of short electrical pulses (1 ms). Our results showed, that pulses near threshold, which caused membrane depolarizations in the monitored area, can lead to action potential upstrokes which show pronounced differences in the occurrence times (taken at 50 % of action potential amplitude) in the range of 4 ms in an area of 0.5 times 0.5 mm2. The pulse induced membrane voltages within the same area, taken at pulse offset, covered the range from 21 to 42 mV. In general, as expected, increasing membrane voltages caused shorter upstroke delays, but this was not always the case resulting in a weak correlation of a linear fit (r=0.57). These findings indicate that the excitation process is based on both, the membrane properties and the tissue structure. Weak pulses near threshold may be applied to trigger action potentials with low, pulse induced disturbances; however, spatially distributed delays within the area of early depolarizations may have to be considered""",,"""H.

"""Application of Geographic information system to calculate the probability of piracy occurrence""","""This paper shows a successful application of Geographic information system to maritime safety. Pirate is a main threat to maritime safety. It is a critical problem to calculate the probability of encountering pirates for a trip.

At first, it is assumed that the probability is equal everywhere in the sea. The average probability of piracy is calculated. Then, an adjusting coefficient is proposed to revise the probability of piracy in each trip. The adjusting coefficient of each trip is related to the average number of piracy in every grid which is calculated in Geographic Information System (GIS) and come across by the trip. Finally, a case study of a trip from Shanghai to the Republic of Kenya is used to illustrate the application of the proposed method. The results show the average probability of encountering pirates in 2012 is 0.0216% when a ship travels a thousand miles.

Besides, disease threat in terms of its severity and susceptibility informed the perceived usefulness of mHealth technology. Individual’s age, literacy in the language used to deliver healthcare information, social influence by the significant peers, and the perceived usefulness of the mHealth technology jointly affected the user’s perceived ease of using the mHealth technology. The findings from this research may guide successful mHealth deployment in rural settings.""",,"""A. Khoda; J. K.

"""P-band SAR Tomography for Forest Type Classification""","""SAR tomography, a technique employing multiple acquisitions over the same areas to form a three-dimensional image, has been demonstrated to improve SAR's capability in many applications. Our study shows the potential value of SAR tomography acquisitions to improve forest classification. By using P-band tomographic SAR data from the German Aerospace Center F -SAR sensor during the AfriSAR campaign in February 2016, the vertical profiles of five different forest types at a tropical forest site in Mondah, Gabon (South Africa) were analyzed and exploited for the classification task. We demonstrated that the high sensitivity of SAR tomography to forest vertical structure enables the improvement of classification performance by up to 33 %. Interestingly, by using the standard Random Forest technique, we found that the ground (i.e., at 5–10 m) and volume layers (i.e., 20–40 m) play an important role in identifying the forest type. Together, these results suggested the promise of the TomoSAR technique for mapping forest types with high accuracy in tropical areas and could provide strong support for the next Earth Explorer BIOMASS spaceborne mission which will collect P-band tomographic SAR data.""",,"""D.

"""Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces For Wireless Communications""","""Reconfigurable Intelligent surface (RIS) is a programmable structure that can be used to control the propagation of electromagnetic waves by changing the electric and magnetic properties of the surface. RIS can customize the radio propagation environments by reconfiguring the phase and amplitude of the incident signals. RIS is a thin surface composed of N elements, each being a reconfigurable scatter: a small antenna receives and re-radiates without amplification, but with a configurable time-delay. RISs are made of passive or active metamaterials. The active metamaterial may be tunable metamaterial by changing the bias voltages of the varactor or PIN diodes, reconfigurable metamaterial using plasma, graphene, vanadium dioxide (VO2) materials and space-time-coding digital metamaterial with the aid of field programmable gate array (FPGA). RIS can be categorized into three types: 1. Reflector type: the RIS only reflects incident signals towards the users on the same side of the base station (BS). 2. Transmissive type: the incident signal will penetrate the RIS and be transmitted towards users on the opposite side of the BS. 3. Hybrid type: the incident signals will be spitted into two parts: one part is transmitted and the other is reflected. The RIS is mainly considered to be a beyond 5G technology operating at frequencies from tens of Gigahertz’s (GHz) to Terahertz’s (THz). At these frequency bands, the signal propagation is heavily attenuated and be blocked completely by the obstacles in the propagation environment. RIS can be made in different shapes, including but not limited to building facades, indoor walls and road bill boards, Typical applications of RIS, can be categorized into two types: 1, wireless communication, RIS can improve the spectrum efficiency, coverage extension and energy efficiency. 2. RF sensing, RIS has a wide range of applications in improving security, smart space, safety and the communication reliability of wireless networks. This talk will be focused on the different RIS types and presented the most recent research activities at FEE Antenna Research Group in Faculty of Electronic Engineering, Menoufia University, Egypt in this topic.""",,"""S.

Many NER systems have been developed, but the annotated data needed for learning is not available for low-resource languages, such as Cameroonian languages. In this paper we exploit the low frequency of named entities in text to define a new suitable word representation for named entity recognition.

"""Architectural Choices for mHealth Services in Finland and Cameroon""","""In the developed world health care sector has used for tens of years information systems in their daily activities. Soon after the Internet usage began to spread to the societies mid 1990'ies the sector began to ponder how to offer services over the web to patients. The USA and the EU began to discuss eHealth scenarios, and many services are now offered, including appointments to doctors and nurses, virtual doctors, and electronic prescriptions. Electronic patient records are widely utilized could also be retrieved by patients and other health care personnel, but due to technical, organizational and legal restrictions this is not yet reality. Mobile networks and high-end mobile terminals are as powerful as laptops were a few years ago and could be used to access and store pertinent health information. In this article we discuss architectural choices that would facilitate the usage of the collected personal health care information, and their pros and cons. We mainly base our findings on the situation in Finland. We contrast, though, the findings with the situation in Cameroon, where the ICT infrastructure is weak and the ICT infrastructure in the health care could more strongly rely on mobile networks and emerging smart terminals.""",,"""J.

"""A new method for estimating the correlation of seismic waveforms based on the NTFT""","""We propose a new correlation function called the similarity coefficient (SC) based on the normal time–frequency transform (NTFT) to evaluate the similarity between two non-stationary seismic signals as a function of the delay time. The SC is defined in the time–frequency spectrum of the NTFT, and the instantaneous phase and amplitude of each frequency component in a signal are used to calculate the SC. Our simulation experiments demonstrate that the SC method can effectively recognize similar signals compared to the conventional normalized cross-correlation coefficient (NCC) under high background noise conditions. The SC presents good robustness in identifying similar signals and performs well in the case of an extremely low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which makes it suitable for detecting weak seismic signals concealed by noise. As a real application case, we use the SC method to detect quasi-Love (QL) surface waves. QL waves are scattered Love waves and are important indicators for lateral anisotropic gradients in the upper mantle. We detect the QL waves at 21 stations deployed across Japan after the 23 December 2004 Mw 8.1 Macquarie earthquake by using the SC method. Obvious QL waves are observed at 19 stations, and we locate the Love-to-Rayleigh scatterers by applying the delay times between the QL and main Love waves. Our results show that the QL wave scatterers were mostly generated in two areas: Mariana subduction and Papua New Guinea. The observations of QL waves suggest the presence of lateral gradients in anisotropy beneath those two areas. The spatial distribution of the 13 scatterers in the Mariana subduction zone agrees well with the Mariana Island Arc, and we infer that the Mariana slab may have melted and coupled with the surrounding mantle at depth.""",,"""W.

"""Opamp-Less Sub-μW/Channel Δ-Modulated Neural-ADC With Super-GΩ Input Impedance""","""The presented 16-channel Δ-modulated neural analog-to-digital converter (ADC) exhibits tolerance to input dc offsets of any value, up to the supply voltage. It employs a dynamic differential-difference comparator architecture with a super-GΩ input impedance ensuring negligible gate-leakage current and well-matched differential inputs resulting in more than 78 dB of rejection of common-mode signals and artifacts. The all-digital nature of the presented Δ-ADC enables sampling of input signals at high oversampling ratios (OSRs) making the front-end immune to stimulation artifacts with differential amplitudes up to a limit that is scalable by the OSR (e.g., 10 mVPP at OSR = 10 k). Moreover, it allows the Δ-ADC to linearly scale down the power consumption required by the application's recording bandwidth. The oversampled Δ-ADC achieves an effective number of bits (ENOB) of 9.7-bit and 2.6- μVRMS integrated input-referred noise over 1 Hz to 500-Hz bandwidth. It uses no large passives or statically biased circuits, such as operational amplifiers (Opamps) saving both channel area (0.011 mm2) and power consumption (0.99 μW). Experimentally measured results validate the key features of the design and include in vivo recordings in freely moving guinea pigs. The fabricated prototype system-on-a-chip (SoC) hosts an array of 16-channel neural-ADC with in-channel digitally programmable high-compliance current-mode biphasic stimulators as well as wireless circuitry for data communication and power/command reception.""",,"""M.

"""Identity management for e-government Libya as a case study""","""Governments are strengthening their identity (ID) management strategies to deliver new and improved online services to their citizens. Such online services typically include applications for different types of permissions, requests for different types of official documents and management of different types of entitlements. The ID management scheme must therefore be able to correctly authenticate citizens and link online presence to real world identities. Many countries, in particular in the developing world, are currently introducing national ID management schemes for the first time. While most of these countries have paper based records, many of these are regionally based and few of these have been consolidated, so these records may contain incorrect, incomplete, inconsistent or redundant information. In this paper, we explore the design space for national ID management and online authentication schemes, in this context. In particular, we propose a simple model for issuing national ID numbers that satisfy these goals and use this model to examine two different ID management schemes implemented in Libya, which allows us to compare different approaches to national identity management. The two schemes were implemented within a fairly short time, so we may assume that the cultural, social, educational and technological factors remain unchanged. This allows a direct comparison of objectives and means. Based on this examination, we evaluate the current Libyan ID number system with respect to the identified objectives. Our evaluation of the two Libyan NID schemes show that if National Identity Management does not fully meet the requirements identified in our simple model, then it may be vulnerable to various forms of online risks such as impersonation and identity theft attacks. Considering online crime, during the design of an Identity Management system, is especially important in developing countries, where such crimes have not previously existed in the society.""",,"""O.

While novel hyperspectral imaging, canopy lidar, and solar-induced fluorescence provide details on species, state, structure, and plant physiology, such data come from different instruments. Thus, post-processing and data fusion struggles with synchronization, spatial overlap, and resolution issues. Especially in the tropical regions of sub-Saharan Africa, these complex, expensive, and bulky instruments remain inaccessible. Here, in Ghana, we have built a low-cost, lightweight, and realistic instrument for simultaneously acquiring hyperspectral data of vegetation fluorescence and canopy structure with perfect spatial overlap. In this paper, we demonstrate the application of the hyperspectral fluorescence lidar for diagnostics and species specificity of locally significant crops. We demonstrate simultaneous range and fluorescence measurements of forest canopy, conducted in full sunlight. Our results indicate that the upper side of the leaves shows a more substantial deviation for stressed plants, while the lower side shows greater contrast for plant species.

The app keeps the identity and location of the users, supports two language interfaces English and Arabic, and works in Android and iOS environments. Only the health care providers can decrypt these data and know about the patient's location. Also, to make the patient trusts the application, his/her information will be deleted after sending his/her negative test after 21 days. In addition, the app provides users with information regarding healthcare places in the case of emergency. For the evaluation of this app, a data was collected from 20 users, including males and females and their ages were between (20–50) in Mosul city. The results showed that the app works properly and the users are notified when they are in close with other registered infected people. In addition, the users found that the app was simple, easy to use, and useful to do contact safely. To convince the users to utilize this app, the app is provided with button trial option to try it.""",,"""A. Fares; M.

"""Usability Evaluation of FinTech Mobile Applications: A Statistical Approach""","""FinTech is an emerging technology comprises of two words i.e. financial and technology. FinTech is proving to be a disruptive technology and is meant to help users in managing their day-to-day financial activities. The FinTech industry is growing up enormously in Pakistan for the last few years, due to the continuous development in information technology; user expectations are continuously increasing in financial services owing to transparency, convenience, privacy and security, moreover, it has simple and effective interface. However, usability issues of FinTech mobile applications across various age groups are still unclear. Usability is the key feature in mobile apps because the term usability is associated with both performance and satisfaction, various questionnaires were conducted among various age groups in this study, and results were analyzed separately by gender. In this study, we found out and elaborate the usability of FinTech mobile apps among various age groups through a quantitative survey and progressively centered analysis around features affecting the elderly people on adopting FinTech mobile apps in Pakistan. Therefore, a quantitative analysis have been applied on the collected data to Figure out the issues of FinTech in detail, which currently has impact on the quality of FinTech mobile apps directly and indirectly. It also provides comprehensive statistical analysis by analyzing and applying on respondents’ profile, frequencies, T-test, reliability test, nonparametric test and descriptive studies through SPSS. Therefore, the interface design must be easy to use for everyone, especially for the elderly. Using the finance related Information apps on cell phones in a superior manner will improve the user’s satisfaction.

"""An Empirical Study of Models and APPs Design of the Adoption Ease of Mobile Payments""","""For many people, mobile phones have become more than just communication devices; they’ve become an integral part of their daily lives. Mobile phone users in Pakistan outnumber those with bank accounts by a wide margin. The purpose of this research is to examine how efficiently people are in adoption of Mobile Payment APPs (MPAPPs). The practice of Theory of Acceptance Model has been applied in this context of embracing Mobile Payment APPs. Two of the most popular mobile payment APPs (JazzCash and Easy-Paisa) in Pakistan have been selected for the analysis. Features of the applications have been experimentally analyzed in the context of technology efficiency and users friendly while, eight of the APPs users have also been interviewed to investigate app performance and efficiency. MPAPPs contain a lot of technological problems that are not user-friendly, according to the findings. It has been found that consumers are less likely to transition to new technologies due to speed of transaction, security and unaware about the use of money transfer mobile apps that’s why consumers are paying or receiving money through shopkeepers’ points rather than performing the transaction themselves through their phones.""",,"""M.

"""Development and Clinical Results from the Virtual Iraq Exposure Therapy Application for PTSD""","""Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is reported to be caused by exposure to an extreme traumatic stressor involving direct personal experience of (or witnessing/learning about) an event that involves actual or threatened death or serious injury, or other threat to one's physical integrity including (but not limited to) military combat, violent personal assault, being kidnapped or taken hostage and terrorist attacks. Such incidents would be distressing to almost anyone, and are usually experienced with intense fear, horror, and helplessness. Initial data suggests that at least 1 out of 5 Iraq War veterans are exhibiting symptoms of depression, anxiety and PTSD. Virtual Reality (VR) delivered exposure therapy for PTSD has been previously used with reports of positive outcomes. The current paper will present the rationale and description of a VR PTSD therapy application (Virtual Iraq/Afghanistan) and present initial findings from a number of early studies of its use with active duty service members. Virtual Iraq/Afghanistan consists of a series of customizable virtual scenarios designed to represent relevant Middle Eastern VR contexts for exposure therapy, including a city and desert road convoy environment. User-centered design feedback needed to iteratively evolve the system was gathered from returning Iraq War veterans in the USA and from a system deployed in Iraq and tested by an Army Combat Stress Control Team. Results from an open clinical trial using Virtual Iraq with 20 treatment completers indicated that 16 no longer met PTSD diagnostic criteria at post-treatment, with only one not maintaining treatment gains at 3 month follow-up.""",,"""A.

"""Law Enforcement Access to Password Protected and/or Encrypted Mobile Data""","""The use of mobile phones in the commission of crime and terrorism pose serious investigative challenges to law enforcement agencies across the world. The discussion deals primarily with the extent a mobile phone service provider and/or or messaging applications provider and/or manufacturer must assist a law enforcement agency in gaining access to mobile data, specifically where the data is encrypted and/or password protected. It should be established whether a mobile phone service and/or applications provider and/or manufacturer must design security and/or privacy measures in such a way that law enforcement may gain access to the encrypted data. It may be argued that national security interests regarding the investigation of serious crimes such as kidnapping, child pornography, corruption and terrorism outweigh user privacy and user security. Terrorism affects all countries globally and in many instances result in the indiscriminate killing of a large number of people as illustrated by the Paris November 2015, the US December 2015, Abidjan, Ivory Coast, Brussels and Pakistan March 2016 killings. Although a law enforcement agency is pressurized to gather as much as possible evidence to investigate such heinous acts and prevent future attacks, the mobile phone evidence must be gathered within a legal framework that provides checks and balances to prevent the development of a police state resulting in the erosion or elimination of human rights. It is necessary to debate whether banning encryption and/or compelling a provider to have the technology to decrypt encrypted mobile communications or override password protected mobile data would serve as an investigative solution in the interest of national security or whether it would ultimately result in weakening user security and privacy to such an extent that all users around the world would be vulnerable to unlawful intrusions.""",,"""M.

"""UAV exploitation: A new domain for cyber power""","""The risks of military unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) being subjected to electronic attack are well recognised, especially following high-profile incidents such as the interception of unencrypted video feeds from UAVs in Iraq and Israel, or the diversion and downing of a UAV in Iran. Protection of military UAV assets rightly focuses on defence against sophisticated cyber penetration or electronic attack, including data link intercepts and navigational spoofing. Offensive activity to counter adversary drone operations presumes a requirement for high-end electronic attack systems. However, combat operations in eastern Ukraine in 2014-16 have introduced an entirely new dimension to UAV and counter-UAV operations. In addition to drones with military-grade standards of electronic defence and encryption, a large number of civilian or amateur UAVs are in operation in the conflict. This presents both opportunities and challenges to future operations combating hybrid threats. Actual operations in eastern Ukraine, in combination with studies of potential criminal or terrorist use of UAV technologies, provide indicators for a range of aspects of UAV use in future conflict. However, apart from the direct link to military usage, UAVs are rapidly approaching ubiquity with a wide range of applications reaching from entertainment purposes to border patrol, surveillance, and research, which imposes an indirect security and safety threat. Issues associated with the unguarded use of drones by the general public range from potentially highly dangerous situations such as failing to avoid controlled airspace, to privacy violations. Specific questions include attribution of UAV activities to the individuals actually directing the drone; technical countermeasures against hacking, interception or electronic attack; and options for controlling and directing adversary UAVs. Lack of attribution and security measures protecting civilian UAVs against electronic attack, hacking or hijacking, with the consequent likelihood of unauthorised use or interception, greatly increases the complication of each of these concerns.""",,"""K.

"""Low Voltage Digitally Controlled Impedance Based Energy Efficient Vedic Multiplier Design on 28nm FPGA""","""Low Voltage Digitally Controlled Impedance (LVDCI) is an I/O standard available on FPGA. This design is LVDCI IO standard based Energy Efficient Vedic Multiplier Design on FPGA. Selection of IO standard play an important role in power dissipation of design. Therefore, we are going to select the most energy efficient IO standards in LVDCI family for Vedic Multiplier. This Vedic multiplier design is a part of project of Vedic arithmetic circuits. The final deliverable of this project is Vedic Processor by merging both concepts of Veda, first book of this world, and the latest technology of this world. In order to test thermal aware design, we want to see that how does an electronic device behave if we change the temperature of surrounding in which it is working. For that purpose we have taken temperatures of four different regions. Furnace Creek Ranch is area of North America recorded the highest temperature of the world that is 56.7°C [1]. Approximately, 53.5°C is the maximum temperature recorded in Mohenjo-Daro situated in Sindh Pakistan [1]. We have also taken median temperature of Delhi i.e. 40°C and standard normal temperature i.e. 21°C. We are operating Vedic Multiplier with the four different temperature and different LVDCI IO standard and observe device performance, and power dissipation. When we use 28nm FPGA under room temperature of 40°C, there are 93.42%, 92.6%, 93.99%, 93.59% and 89.79% reduction in total power dissipation of Vedic multiplier using LVDCI 15, LVDCI 18, LVDCI DV2 15, LVDCI DV2 18 and HSLVDCI 15 respectively. Similarly, when we use 28nm FPGA, there is approximately 90-96% reduction in leakage power dissipation of Vedic multiplier using different LVDCI and different temperature. There is no change in I/O power with change in temperature for uniform IO standard. When we use different IO standard of LVDCI family, there is significant reduction in leakage power.

"""HIPAA and QMS Based Architectural Requirements to Cope with the OCR Audit Program""","""The United States legislation known as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) is aimed at strengthening patient rights, increasing efficiency and decreasing administrative costs in the healthcare industry. Under HIPAA all Covered Entities are required to ensure compliance with certain privacy and security rules concerned with protecting private patient health information. Building upon the objectives of HIPAA, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009, in Section 13411 of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, required the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to conduct periodic audits of Covered Entities against HIPAA Security Rule. This paper presents and evaluates a new approach which might be used by Covered Entities to achieve compliance with HIPAA by adopting the ISO 9001 guidelines. A United States based Healthcare IT Company (UHITC) with a backup office in Pakistan was taken as a case study for this approach. UHITC develops software for mobile devices along with providing third party medical billing services. In connection with its achieving ISO 9001 certification since 2004, UHITC had already developed a company-wide quality audit protocol based on the ISO 9001 standard. For purposes of conforming the ISO standards to the HIPAA audit protocol in a streamlined fashion, UHITC examined the HIPAA requirements to determine whether the existing protocol could be tailored to achieve HIPAA compliance. In order to accomplish this evaluation, the two standards were compared by cross-mapping their components. The comparison revealed that the controls mentioned in the ISO 9001 guideline meet or exceed the HIPAA Security Rule for 36% of the implementation requirements. UHITC was also able to increase customer satisfaction by achieving compliance with HIPAA Security Rule using a quality management system (QMS) model. At the next level, Compliance Attributes (CA) were derived from these requirements and classified as architectural and non-architectural in nature. A new approach to define compliance oriented software architecture using compliance tactic was also proposed.""",,"""S. U. Gardazi; A. A. Shahid; C.

"""Proposed Vision for Green Buildings in Iraq""","""Buildings are consuming for energy and natural resources, and environmentally polluting, in contrast to green buildings that reduce energy consumption, conserve natural resources from access, reduce polluting emissions, and provide a healthy and safe environment for residents. The research conducted a questionnaire of stakeholders in the construction and implementation sectors. The questionnaire showed that there are many problems that limit the trend towards the application of green buildings in Iraq, which is the problem of this research. The results of the analysis of the questionnaire revealed the presence of 26 problems, the most important of which is the weakness of the concept of green buildings in the society in general and the refusal of change and move towards the adoption of green buildings when constructing buildings in Iraq by 93.7%. In addition, the most important factors affecting the inability to move towards green buildings are the legal, technical, design, planning, financial, intellectual, functional, technological, construction and sustainability factors. The research aims to prepare a future vision and proposals to address the problems and factors that affect the weak demand for green buildings in Iraq. These proposals might be legal, technical, design, planning, financial, strategic and technical, that could help decision-makers and those interested in the construction and environment sectors to prepare drafts, codes and decisions for the transformation to green buildings. The research recommends the establishment of a higher council for green buildings in Iraq, which will be linked to the Council of Ministers, which will include government ministries such as housing, municipalities, science and technology and higher education and scientific research, as well as the private sector (companies and organizations), to achieve partnership and integration between them for promoting the green building sector in Iraq.""",,"""N.

"""On the use of Green's summation for tsunami waveform estimation: a case study""","""The method presented here aims to assess the tsunami threat very rapidly after the occurrence of a large earthquake, using as input the parameters of the seismic source, and an approach based on Green's summation. We show that the main weakness of the approach (the need to consider only linear shallow water propagation) is largely compensated by the advantages in terms of computing performance and independence with respect to pre-computed scenarios. To test the approach and to illustrate its implementation in a real environment, we focus on the Sea of Oman, a tsunamigenic area characterized by Makran subduction zone which detailed structure is partially unknown and where secondary tsunami sources must also be taken into account, both for hazard studies and warning purposes. The potential source area is partitioned into a grid of unity water sources. A shallow water (SW) numerical model is used to pre-compute the corresponding empirical Green's functions on several points of interest located on the coasts of Iran, Pakistan and Oman. The comparison between Green's summation and the direct SW computation using the full resolution of the bathymetric grid shows that the accuracy is good enough for practical applications.""",,"""J.

The proposed model is based on the application of a suite of computer attack analysis tools to increase the level of security of the company's processes. The proposal is based on 6 phases: 1. Assess risks, 2. Implement controls, 3. Define a treatment plan, 4. Process mining, 5. Data visualization and 6. Evaluation of results. The proposal was validated through an experimental case of a cyber-attack on a medical establishment in Lima, Peru, which did not have fitting controls and contingency plans within its business processes. Preliminary results show that in the face of the support of the instruments of our model the level of security has increased by 25% with our proposal.""",,"""I. P. Cardenas; M. Espinoza; J.

"""Influence of a Mobile Application With Augmented Reality ANATOMY-3D in Learning of Bone System""","""The pandemic caused by COVID-19, although it is considered a threat to humanity, also changed the life of the entire planet in different aspects, one of them is education because in a short time it converted the classic face-to-face stage into a virtual stage, a product of compulsory confinement in almost every country in the world. In Peru, this change has many negative consequences, since teachers do not have or know of virtual technological tools to support the student in the learning process. To alleviate this problem, an augmented reality mobile application called ANATOMY-3D was developed, to help students learn and recognize the bones of bone system in 3D. The influence of ANATOMY-3D on the learning of students from a school in the Apurimac region, in Peru, was evaluated, for this, 53 students were taken as a sample, dividing them into an experimental group (GE1) and a control group (G2). the experimental group used ANATOMY-3D and the control group used the traditional method. The results were analyzed in three dimensions: usability, motivation, and a knowledge questionnaire. The results showed that ANATOMY-3D has a good level of usability, promotes better motivation in students to use ANATOMY-3D compared to the traditional method. Finally, the questionnaire showed that ANATOMY-3D positively influences the learning and recognition of the bones of bone system, as it achieved better scores for the experimental group (G1), compared to the control group (G2), with a difference of 0.88 in the mean of the grades.""",,"""H.

"""Blockchain based Digital Identity Management System: A Case Study of Myanmar""","""Although Blockchain technology is formerly invented for digital currencies such as Bitcoin, its applications have extended into such areas as fair voting, healthcare, banking, and digital identity. A blockchain `s data is cryptographically connected and distributed across multiple computers, making them nearly impossible to temper with. Hence, this paper considers the possible use of introducing blockchain technology for digital identity management system for the issue of digital identity (passport) in Myanmar. Through blockchain technology, all the passport offices in Myanmar will be connected to each other in decentralized environment and enough passport information of a person can be securely shared within peers. Therefore, the proposed system can hinder the illegal duplication of passports (different types) since a valid passport can be issued only once to a person (except passport loss, renewal and expired) and it is impossible for a person to apply more than one passport type in the decentralized system. In addition, in the proposed system, the authenticity of passport can also be verified after granting permission for international travel. Therefore, the proposed system can be effectively applied for the passport offices in Myanmar for verifying the passport application and its data authentication.""",,"""M. Htet; P. T. Yee; J. R.

"""A Novel Remote User Authentication Scheme by using Private Blockchain-Based Secure Access Control for Agriculture Monitoring""","""Pakistan is an agricultural country and its economy is mainly dependent on agriculture. Agriculture provides large economic opportunities along with the yield of food and other raw materials in our life. To increase the yield of products there is a need for the deployment of modern technology. To tackle this problem, a private blockchain-based secure access control for agriculture can be employed to monitor the different climatic parameters such as (light, humidity, temperature, and, soil moisture, etc) in the fields. The environmental and climatic parameters are very important for the quantity, quality, efficient growth of the crops. Also, any kind of unwanted modification, interception, and expunction on these parameters can leave a bad impact on fields and crops. Therefore, privacy and security are key challenges while deploying the monitoring systems in the fields. In this regard, we have designed a novel remote user authentication scheme by using private blockchain-based secure access control for agriculture monitoring. The proposed scheme is authorized through private blockchain access control (PBAC) algorithms and is applied using hyper ledger cello tools. We customarily analyze the privacy and security of the scheme by using a random oracle model. Furthermore, the proposed protocol is secure and resist different sorts of malicious attacks. The proposed scheme is also suitable in a real-life application to avoid all kinds of security attacks.""",,"""J. Arshad; M. A. B. Siddique; Z. Zulfiqar; A. Khokhar; S. Salim; T. Younas; A. U.

"""A Review of Cyber-Attack Methods in Cyber-Physical Power System""","""With the application of advanced computer and communication technologies, modern power system transformed into cyber-physical power system (CPPS). CPPS is critical infrastructure for modern society, which has complex dual-direction information flow. The information interactions make CPPS vulnerable to cyber-attacks, resulting in serious consequences in extreme cases. Some power system blackouts accidents had occurred around the world in recent years, such as Ukraine blackouts in 2015 and Venezuela blackouts in 2019. Consequently, it is necessary to summarize and analyze cyber-attack methods on CPPS for the defense against cyber-attacks. In this paper, a review of cyber-attack methods on CPPS is summarized and analyzed. Firstly, this paper summarizes the principles of different cyber-attack methods, such as false data injection attack (FDIA), denial-of-service (DoS) attack and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, etc. Secondly, the paper analyzes the applicable scenarios of different cyber-attack methods and studies possible attack methods on equipment and systems such as state estimation, wide area measurement systems (WAMS), smart meters and so on.

"""Uncovering Price Puzzle in the Wheat Economy of Pakistan: An Application of Artificial Neural Networks""","""Wheat is at the epicenter of global food security. Extreme wheat price volatility can contribute to broader social risks in terms of food security, human development and have a significant influence on farmers' incomes in the coming years especially in developing countries like Pakistan. Wheat is not only the major staple crop of the country's food security, but it also contributes about 10.3% in agriculture which accounts for 2.2% of domestic GDP. However, the presumable intensification in climate change and macroeconomic instability is reputed as a threat to wheat price stability nationwide. Against this backdrop, this research develops a precise wheat price puzzle forecasting model using the Long- Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM-RNN) - an application of Artificial Intelligence. LSTM-RNN are proficient in handling non-linear complex systems owing to their special LSTM nodes. An assessment of the planned framework with a handful of prevailing models is also discussed. Results showed that LSTM-RNN outperformed in terms of accuracy and uncovered that wheat prices will progressively swell and shrink by 2030, which will pose menaces to the whole economy.

"""An Approach for Developing Integrated Decision Support System Model for Optimizing Contracting Process of Public Procurement in Pakistan""","""Public procurement expenditure accounts for 45 to 65 percent of a national budget, often equating to at least 15-20 percent of a country's gross domestic product and these estimates are even higher for developing countries like Pakistan. Due to weaknesses in current operational procedures of Public Procurement in Pakistan, it is approximately paying between US$ 31 to US$ 62 Billion more annually than it should be for procuring of goods, works and services. The inefficiency in operations of public procurement like long lead time of process results in funds lapse of allocated budget, which simply indicates the inefficient public funds utility. As the research scope is limited to public procurement of goods so the problem of inefficient public funds utilization will amplify in form of long term forecasts, high level of inventories, high costs, high cost and slow response to end user requirements. Since Public funds are scarce in developing country like Pakistan, so to warrant the efficient use of the resources this research work lays the basis for developing a technical and business model for optimizing the operational delay in public procurement process especially the phase of contracting, as in this phase most time is consumed and it's the most critical of all other phases, especially in public procurement of goods.

"""Status study on sustainability of satellite communication systems under hostile jamming environment""","""Globalization of commerce and interlinking of economics of all the countries in the world have changed the configurations of local/national/regional Communication links. They have now become truly global network centric. Satellite communication links offer flexible data transmission for ground, sea and airborne units. For military, these satellites have enhanced their capabilities with better co-ordination of command and control. Military satellites use more expensive, complex and jam resistant technologies to reduce their vulnerability to jamming. As of now large number of countries including India do not have adequate number of Mil - Satellites. Even advanced countries used the existing Commercial Satellites by leasing the transponders in times of need like in Desert storm, Iraq war, Afgan war etc. Commercial satellites use FDM-FDMA, FDM-TDMA modulations, which are vulnerable to jamming unlike the Mil - Satellites which use spread spectrum, EHF frequencies, multiple beam transmitting and receiving antennas with nulling capabilities against jamming, processing transponders etc. There are number of instances where in the rogue states and terrorists have disrupted communication. This has become a key concern for military and civilian governments. Another area where satellites are increasingly being used are in Personal communication field also known as Mobile Satellite Services. The location of increasing number of Base Stations in the vicinity of domestic dwellings as a part of cellular phone infrastructure, has created scare about the RF safety among health conscious public (through it is not conclusively proved). Mobile Satellite services are now being considered as a Green alternative to cellular phones.

"""A New Strategy for the Detection of Diabetic Retinopathy using a Smartphone App and Machine Learning Methods Embedded on Cloud Computer""","""Diabetes is a major cause of blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, stroke and lower limb amputation according to World Health Organization (WHO). Complications from poor diabetes management lead to the Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) which is a leading cause of acquired blindness in the working-age population worldwide. WHO estimated that DR accounts for ≈ 15-17% of all cases of total blindness in the US and Europe, 7% of all cases in China and Mongolia. In Brazil, according to the Ministry of Health, the disease affects 7.6% of the population. A cost saving intervention includes screening and treatment for retinopathy. Detecting the different lesions related to DR plays an important role towards the stage detection, prediction, and prevention. Our challenge here is to design a deep learning neural network able to fully detect such lesions in digital retinal fundus image to help building robust and scaled solutions to tackle this urgent diabetes scenario. These results show that the Diavision Portable device had a better performance using GLCM, LBP and SVM, presenting 100% for both evaluation metrics considered. Using Messidor dataset were obtained better performance with VGG16 and SVM, archiving 100% for all metrics. In terms of feature extraction time, the GLCM and VGG16 presented acceptable times, respectively, 17.63ms and 37.87ms.""",,"""S. S. A. Alves; A. G. Matos; J. S. Almeida; C. A. Benevides; C. C. H.

"""Imagery-based modeling of social, economic, and governance indicators in sub-Saharan Africa""","""Many policy and national security challenges require understanding the social, cultural, and economic characteristics of a country or region. Addressing failing states, insurgencies, terrorist threats, societal change, and support for military operations require a detailed understanding of the local population. Information about the state of the economy, levels of community support and involvement, and attitudes toward government authorities can guide decision makers in developing and implementing policies or operations. However, such information is difficult to gather in remote, inaccessible, or denied areas. Draper's previous work demonstrating the application of remote sensing to specific issues, such as population estimation, agricultural analysis, and environmental monitoring, has been very promising. In recent papers, we extended these concepts to imagery-based prediction models for governance, well-being, and social capital. Social science theory indicates the relationships among physical structures, institutional features, and social structures. Based on these relationships, we developed models for rural Afghanistan and validated the relationships using survey data. In this paper we explore the adaptation of those models to sub-Saharan Africa. Our analysis indicates that, as in Afghanistan, certain attributes of the society are predictable from imagery-derived features. The automated extraction of relevant indicators, however, depends on both spatial and spectral information. Deriving useful measures from only panchromatic imagery poses some methodological challenges and additional research is needed.""",,"""J. Irvine; J. Kimball; J. Lepanto; J. Regan; R.

This results in high mortality rates all over Pakistan. To uplift the current architecture of healthcare in Pakistan, it is vital to develop a sustainable solution for continuous health monitoring and arrest anomalous physiological behavior before they become life-threatening. In the same pretext, this study proposes a working paper which aims to disseminate interim results of smart cardiac health monitoring using an amalgam of IoMT and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The primary objective of the proposed research is to integrate state-of-the-art ML classification algorithms to detect, in near real-time, abnormal human vitals like electrocardiogram(ECG), heart-rate(HR), blood pressure(BP), etc. As network latency is critical to this application, therefore, to improve overall Quality of Service (QoS) of the system, we propose to fuse Edge Intelligence interfaced with multiple IoMT enabled bio-sensors. These sensors will form a body area sensor network(BSN) that records cardiac-related human vitals. In our preliminary research, that is presented in this paper, we trained several machine learning algorithms on the MIMIC-III clinical data-set and reviewed their performance.

To achieve this criteria, we created a cloud-based virtual laboratory based on OpenStack cloud platform to facilitate access to virtual machine both locally and remotely. Cloud-based virtual labs bring a lot of advantages, such as increased manageability, scalability, high availability and flexibility, to name a few. This arrangement has been tested in a case-study exercise with a group of students as part of Computer Networks and System Administration courses at Kabul Polytechnic University in Afghanistan. To measure success, we introduced a level test to be completed by participants prior and after the experiment. As a result, the learners achieved an average of 17.1 % higher scores in the post level test after completing the practical exercises. Lastly, we distributed a questionnaire after the experiment and students provided positive feedback on the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed solution.""",,"""M. N. Kabiri; M.

"""Drinking Water Monitoring in Mosul City Using IoT""","""Mosul is one of the cities of Iraq, which was attacked by fierce terrorist organizations called ISIS since 2014-2017 destroyed all the infrastructure of the city. After liberation the city from ISIS by the Iraqi forces had to return to normal life and repair all the destroyed topic of the city. The most important of these topics is for return drinking water and elimination of water pollution by testing and monitoring the water in real time with modern technology to use the best drinking water in addition to reach Mosul city as a smart city. In this paper, designed and implemented the proposed system by using internet of thing with low cost and instant results for the purpose of testing drinking water in real time for many important parameters of the water, such as Temperature, pH, TDS, Turbidity, and Conductivity,. Each parameter can be measured by the sensor. All these sensors connected to the Arduino UNO model can be used as a core controller and send the data to the internet through the Wi-Fi module (ESP 8266). Finally, the sensor data can be viewed on the internet using ThingSpeak API for the purpose of collecting information, analyzing and sending it for display on LCD or Mobile or Laptop. The results were compared with laboratory results in the “Right water project/Mosul”. The proposed system was very powerful, short time to execute, very cheap, and highly efficient.

"""Accelerated Multi Stress Aging and Life Estimation of Polymeric Insulators""","""Ceramic insulating materials are widely used for HV and EHV applications and were used for many decades. However, these materials response in a polluted environment and lack of hydrophobicity, high maintenance cost, etc., make them vulnerable. From the past decade, polymeric insulators evolved as the best replacement of these traditional materials. However, improvement in long term performance, service life and their aging behavior under different stresses in the field is still a challenging task for researchers. The impact of the environment on the performance of these insulators may vary depending on the severity of environment which necessitates, the proper investigation of performance for different environmental conditions, specifically for the regions having polluted environment. To understand the aging behavior and effects of different stresses on polymeric insulators, various aging techniques are applied worldwide. A lot of research is going on the natural as well as multi stress aging of polymeric insulators. Multi stress accelerated aging is an attractive technique used to simulate the effects of actual field environment and to analyze the long term service performance in a quite short time span. In this paper, the results of 10,000 hours of the aging test under accelerated multi stresses of the polymeric insulators are presented. Silicon rubber (SiR) is chosen from thermoset type and thermoplastic elastomeric (TPE) is chosen from the thermoplastic group. These insulators were applied multi stresses in accelerated weather chamber to be aged. The seasons (summer/winter) and time (day/night) are simulated for the weather cycles. The environmental region of Hattar, Pakistan, was simulated for designing the weather cycles which is an industrial area having high pollution index. The environmental stresses include heat, UV-A, acid rain and salt fog. The insulators selected for aging in this study are known as 10 kV distribution class insulators. The electrical analysis is based on leakage current and physical analysis are discoloration & classification of hydrophobicity, while material analysis technique considered here is Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). This study showed that the TPE insulator lost its hydrophobicity initially with aging while SiR showed better hydrophobicity. Both TPE and SiR showed better leakage current suppression under the simulated environment of Hattar. Investigation of SiR and TPE insulators performance for the long term in the polluted industrial zone and their comparison under the same stresses condition with each other are the two main objectives of the study. Results revealed that both of the insulators are appropriate for the environment.""",,"""Israrullah; M. Amin; A. Mahmood; A.

"""A new method to determine the freeze-thaw erosion""","""Freeze-thaw erosion is the third largest soil erosion type after water erosion and wind erosion, which is a serious threat to agricultural land and various buildings, especially for water projects. In this paper, a new method based on the passive microwave remote sensing technique was proposed to classify and assess the freeze-thaw erosion. The core of this new method is at two important indices: the freeze-thaw cycling days per year, and the phase transition water content per day. The first index can be used to determine the freeze-thaw erosion region and the second index can be used to evaluate the degree of freeze-thaw erosion. The application of this new method in China shows good result.

"""Remote sensing analysis of quaternary deformation using river networks in Hindukush region""","""The Hindukush region in north-western Pakistan is amongst the most active geomorphic regions in the world and is bounded by principal active zones. This study focuses on the application of remote sensing techniques in order to show the spatial variation of uplift and deformation along the Tirch Mir Massif and Shyok suture zone in the eastern Hindukush. Stream profile analysis and box counting techniques were employed on drainage network extracted from digital elevation model (DEM) to calculate the geomorphic indices and fractal dimension. The estimation of fractal dimensions allows us to measure the degree of complexity by evaluating how the dimension measurement increases or decreases at different scales with respect to the vulnerability of the surface deformation (surface roughness). The objective is to quantify the influence of neotectonic activity on the drainage system by measuring the reduction in complexity as the deformation intensity increases. We used a steepness index map to prepare a relative uplift rate map of the area. It is also observed that the main control over the drainage system is tectonic uplift. Quaternary faults in the region control local drainages and the deflection of rivers and stream offsets is a further evidence of neotectonic activity. This study can be improved by using high resolution imagery and GPS data. The anomalous and heterogeneous behaviour of drainage pattern, seismicity and fractal dimension values also prove the active nature of the Hindukush region.""",,"""S. A. Mahmood; F. Shahzad; R.

"""Oil Price Prediction Using Deep Neural Network Technique Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Multivariate Analysis""","""The prediction of oil prices and determining the percentage of increase or decline in their prices is one of the most important factors influencing the economy of countries and an effective influence on the budget of any oil country, including Iraq, and a key factor in the labor market in general. Forecasting techniques represent an effective tool for discovering knowledge from large and complex databases in several areas, including oil prices. In this work, a forecasting model will be designed and implemented that determines oil prices based on seven basic characteristics. The proposed system is based on knowledge discovery techniques through data analysis (which includes 7 characteristics to six years). The proposed model consists of three main stages that start with a pre-processing of the data, especially since the data contains missing data with some characteristics, then the application of the prediction algorithm on the resulting data and ends with the evaluation of the model based on real data. The first stage focused on initializing the data and it includes converting the data within a specific range and finding the data that is outlier or missing. In the second stage, the model uses a deep learning technique, in which a deep neural network called the Recurrent Gate Unit and Multivariate Analysis (Deep Neural Network Technique Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Multivariate Analysis) is used, which reduces the prediction error. This algorithm is characterized by the process of updating the values of the variable to be predicted, as well as addressing the weaknesses in prediction techniques that rely on neural networks computations. The algorithm was developed using the correlation metric as an alternative to traditional metrics for predicting continuous numerical values. In the third stage, the prediction model is evaluated based on a set of approved error measures, and we will try to prove the superiority of the results of the developed algorithm that depends on correlation in reducing error rates and training and testing time compared to the original algorithm""",,"""H.

"""Techno-Economo-Environmental Viability Assessment of Grid-Connected Photovoltaic System- A Case for Different Cities of Pakistan""","""It is established fact that with the increased demand of electricity and depletion of conventional energy sources reserves, lately researchers are recommending the use of standalone and grid connected photovoltaic (PV) systems. Pakistan has ~2.324 million MW capacity of electricity generation through solar PV applications which is hardly exploited. This work is focused on analyzing the technical, economic, and environmental aspects of a standalone photovoltaic system installed in five different cities of Pakistan (Faisalabad, Sakkar, Bhakkar, Gawadar and Abbotabad). Simulations are carried out on ""RETScreen"" for 1 kW system capacity. The weather data used in simulation is reported by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Technical analysis is performed in terms of capacity factor and electricity delivered to load. The economics of the designed system is investigated considering different economic paradigms including its whole-sum present value, rate of return, payback time, benefit-cost ratio and annual life cycle savings. Outcomes elaborate that Abbottabad is the most feasible location among selected locations with 4.1 years payback period, while Bhakkar and Gwadar are the least feasible with 4.6 years payback period.""",,"""R.

"""An Overview of Leading Biometrics Technologies Used for Human Identity""","""The advent of Biometrics Technologies has automated the identification of people by one or more of their distinct physical or behavioral characteristics. The term Biometrics covers a wide range of technologies that can be used to verify identity by measuring and analyzing human characteristics. These technologies provide a way to rely on the attributes of an individual instead of relying on things that an individual may have or know. In this paper, we provide an overview of all the leading biometrics technologies which are widely used throughout the world for automated, reliable and efficient identification of human. We explored the methods of implementation of each technology and on the basis of this exploration. We also proposed a comparative feasibility for the implementation of each technology in connection with a wide range of applications such as Electronic Access Control, Time and Attendance, ATM, Inmate booking & release/parole ID, Elimination of welfare frauds in benefits disbursements and Information Security.

"""Pakistani Standard Vehicle Plates Recognition using Deep Neural Networks""","""With many applications in security, surveillance, and intelligent transportation systems, Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) is a fundamental and important task. In the recent era with the growth of Deep Learning (DL) techniques, ALPR also has shown dramatically accurate results as other computer vision problems. Most of the practical ALPR systems are country-specific, for example, a lot of work has been done for Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, American, or European vehicle plates that have specific vehicle plate format. This work focuses on vehicle plate recognition for multiple formats implemented in the same country or state. For this purpose, Pakistan has been chosen where license plates have unique formatting styles even within different provinces that enhance the complexity of character segmentation and recognition, and ultimately make it a challenging problem. Moreover, due to commercialization and privacy concerns, there was no publicly available dataset of Pakistani license plates, so we have built our own dataset under different environmental conditions like sunny, foggy, or night-time. Also, the dataset contains some blurred, angled, and distorted images. We achieved 90.13% segmentation accuracy for standard number plates. After this, for correct recognition of characters, we have developed an eight layers Deep Neural Network (DNN) model and achieved 97.19% classification accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first-ever system developed for Pakistani vehicle plates using DNN where distorted images have also been considered in the dataset and a reasonable accuracy is achieved.""",,"""R. u.

"""Improving Tuberculosis Diagnostics Using Deep Learning and Mobile Health Technologies among Resource-Poor and Marginalized Communities""","""Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic infectious disease worldwide and remains a major cause of death globally. Of the estimated 9 million people who developed TB in 2013, over 80% were in South-East Asia, Western Pacific, and African. The majority of the infected populations was from resource-poor and marginalized communities with weak healthcare infrastructure. Reducing TB diagnosis delay is critical in mitigating disease transmission and minimizing the reproductive rate of the tuberculosis epidemic. The combination of machine learning and mobile computing techniques offers a unique opportunity to accelerate the TB diagnosis among these communities. The ultimate goal of our research is to reduce patient wait times for being diagnosed with this infectious disease by developing new machine learning and mobile health techniques to the TB diagnosis problem. In this paper, we first introduce major technique barriers and proposed system architecture. Then we report two major progresses we recently made. The first activity aims to develop large-scale, real-world and well-annotated X-ray image database dedicated for automated TB screening. The second research activity focus on developing effective and efficient computational models (in particularly, deep convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based models) to classify the image into different category of TB manifestations. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach.

Census data, collected every five or ten years, is the only source for socioeconomic indicators. Thus, local authorities need ways of producing more frequently updated indicators. Studies conducted for developed countries (Europe and USA) use Call Detail Records (CDRs) for such a purpose. In our study we propose to exploit patterns observed in developing countries, specifically in Latin America, where mobile phone usage is pervasive even among the poorest and the dominant modality for purchasing mobile airtime is the prepaid scheme (top-ups). We analyze more than 1M top-up transactions together with more than 5K online classified ads for housing sales to predict the socioeconomic status measured at an intra-urban level for 89 neighborhoods. Using a Linear Regression with Regularization L1 (Lasso), we can explain the economic status with a prediction rate up to 71% for urban neighborhoods in Guayaquil, Ecuador.

Additionally, we select datasets from two English based Internet applications, Faithwrit-er and Facebook. We analyze these six datasets based on several common indicators, including popular passwords, password structure and letter distribution. The analysis results show that there are remarkable differences in different user groups. The experiments show that geographical factors (embodied in the native language) and types of website services play a significant role in password creation. We further evaluate the security of these passwords by employing two state-of-the-art password cracking techniques.

"""Seismic Microwave Brightness Temperature Anomaly Detection Using Multitemporal Passive Microwave Satellite Images: Ideas and Limits""","""Thermal anomalies related to large earthquakes are frequently reported, but focus on the inconsistencies and uncertainties in the uncovered results caused by the diverse method used, data used, and case studies is lacking. Taking seismic anomaly detection using passive microwave remote sensing as an example, this study revealed and illustrated the time series of microwave brightness temperature (MBT) anomaly associated with the May 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, the April 2010 Yushu earthquake, the April 2013 Lushan earthquake, and the April and May 2015 Nepal earthquake sequence. Cross comparison showed that the spatial distribution of MBT anomalies behaves differently with different background-removal methods. More regional and detailed MBT anomalies (but with weaker intensities) were obtained with higher frequency data, whereas more pronounced MBT anomalies (but with fewer details) were acquired with lower frequency data. The amplitude and spatial scales of MBT anomalies at H polarization were larger than that at V polarization. And 10.7 GHz at H polarization was recommended as the optimal band. The spatiotemporal evolutions of MBT anomalies associated with the four selected earthquake cases were compared and found to be closely related to respective earthquake preparation mechanisms. The aforementioned characteristics and uncertainties of MBT anomalies under different conditions were then discriminated and discussed based on microwave remote-sensing physics, and the applications and limitations of the present study were illustrated and analyzed. The findings of this study are of great significance for remote sensing data selection, reliability assessment, and result interpretation in seismic-anomaly research.""",,"""Y. Qi; Z. Miao; L. Wu; Y.

"""The Ubiquitous Healthcare Facility Framework: A Proposed System for Managing Rural Antenatal Care""","""Ubiquitous computing is playing a vital role in the provision of healthcare services through advanced technologies. The ubiquitous environment where resources can be accessed by anyone at anytime regardless of location have brought revolution in delivery and accessibility of healthcare services even in remote areas. Therefore, in recent years more research contributions can be seen to propose digitalized healthcare services in the form of mobile and e-Services that are accessible through ubiquitous devices. To exploit the underlining potential of ubiquitous computing, in this research we have proposed a ubiquitous healthcare framework for provision of healthcare services in remote rural areas in province of Punjab, Pakistan. The research has employed a case study research approach to understand the phenomena in depth and in its real context. The unit of analysis is provision of antenatal and child healthcare services at basic health units in the selected region. The case study is constructed through field study by engaging healthcare professionals working at basic health units and data is collected through focus group interviews with healthcare professionals. A proof-of-the-concept ubiquitous framework is proposed as part of the case study by constructing various services to facilitate healthcare professionals in rural areas. To evaluate the proposed ubiquitous framework, an evaluation framework based on usability, information system and ISO models is constructed. Hypothesis are constructed to measure user satisfaction through twelve constructs of the evaluation framework that include availability, adaptability, memorability, effectiveness, responsiveness, cognitive load, error recovery, ease to understand, ease of learning, efficiency of use, navigation, and execution. The data is collected through field surveys by conducting walkthroughs with healthcare professionals in rural areas. The analysis of the data is carried out by employing structured equation modeling in SPSS. The results provide highly significant relationship between constructs and user satisfaction.

"""Attentional Dense Convolutional Neural Network for Water Body Extraction From Sentinel-2 Images""","""Monitoring water bodies from remote sensing data is certainly an essential task to supervise the actual conditions of the available water resources for environment conservation, sustainable development, and many other applications. Being Sentinel-2 images some of the most attractive data, existing traditional index-based and deep learning-based water extraction methods still have important limitations in effectively dealing with large heterogeneous areas since many types of water bodies with different spatial-spectral complexities are logically expected. Note that, in this scenario, optimal feature abstraction and neighborhood information may certainly vary from water to water pixel, however existing methods are generally constrained by a fix abstraction level and amount of land cover context. To address these issues, this article presents a new attentional dense convolutional neural network (AD-CNN) especially designed for water body extraction from Sentinel-2 imagery. On the one hand, the AD-CNN exploits dense connections to allow uncovering deeper features while simultaneously characterizing multiple data complexities. On the other hand, the proposed model also implements a new residual attention module to dynamically put the focus on the most relevant spatial-spectral features for classifying water pixels. To test the performance of the AD-CNN, a new water database of Nepal (WaterPAL) is also built. The conducted experiments reveal the competitive performance of the proposed architecture with respect to several traditional index-based and state-of-the-art deep learning-based water extraction models.""",,"""J.

"""An assessment of the threats to the aquatic resources due to rapid growth in the extraction of Shale gas in the US: An application to the Kurdistan region of Iraq""","""As of 2015 only four countries in the world are producing Shale gas on a commercial scale. These are Argentina, China, Canada and the US, with the latter producing approximately 90% of the total share. Even though for the case of US, the economic benefits of Shale gas extraction have been substantial, there exists considerably uncertainty in determining its environmental sustainability which is the main motivation behind this work. This effort is accomplished in three steps. In the first step, based on the literature available in the US, a comprehensive assessment of the threats to aquatic resources due to rapid growth in the extraction of Shale gas is carried out. Secondly, to address those identified risks recommendations are proposed to mitigate the adverse impacts. And in the third step, its applicability to Kurdistan region is assessed. Although at present Kurdistan is not producing any Shale gas commercially, the environmental impact studies conducted in the US will aid the Kurdistan government in shaping the future energy policies pertaining to sustainable Shale gas development.""",,"""P.

"""Security and Usability Analysis of Online Banking Applications in Pakistan""","""As a result of COVID-19, a lot of users in Pakistan switched to online banking. However, the most significant obstacles to the widespread use of online banking applications are security and usability concerns.This research aims to analyze the security and usability of online banking applications in Pakistan. An investigation of security, usability, users’ education, and comparison with international online banking applications is carried out in this study. In the first phase of this study, a survey was conducted on 302 participants to collect data from end-users perspectives in Pakistan. The statistical analysis tool SPSS was used to analyze the survey findings. In the second phase of this study, a limited number of experts were interviewed to better understand the survey findings. Survey and interview findings were compared to highlight the strength and weaknesses of online banking applications in Pakistan. Additionally, this study aims to identify users’ needs and provide suggestions for improving the acceptance and usage of online banking applications in Pakistan.The results indicate that the use of mobile banking is relatively high as compared to other online banking applications. Most users are not familiar with all the features, and functions provided in online banking. Users are still experiencing significant difficulties in logging in, especially after a long time of inactivity. Additional authentication other than OTP is needed at the time of the transaction. Users should be educated about security features and security measures to avoid online attacks while banking online. It is hoped that the findings of this study will help online banking service providers in Pakistan to recognize usability, security, and user education issues and make their services more secure, usable, and convenient.

"""Performance Analysis of Identifying SQL Injection Vulnerability in the Context of Bangladeshi Websites""","""SQL injection is one of the most dangerous vulnerabilities for Web applications, and it is becoming a more common source of assaults as more and more systems migrate to the Web. Hackers modify the SQL query submitted by the user and insert malicious code into it. As a result, they get access to the database and change the data. Like developed countries, developing countries provide services to their citizens through various online portals, web applications, and websites to keep up with the global pace of digitalization. When it comes to websites, cybersecurity is one of the most frequently discussed topics, and ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of data have become increasingly important to businesses. Unfortunately, many web-based services are vulnerable to serious security threats due to a failure to consider vulnerability issues during the development phase. Vulnerability statistics are required for these developing countries to gain insight into the current security status of the web services provided. SQL injection is one of the most widely used techniques by hackers to take advantage of a security flaw in a website. The primary focus of this work is to compare performances of detecting SQLi vulnerabilities by presenting step by demonstration of two different third-party tools namely Havij and SQLmap. For the purpose of performance measure, we have tested 150 Bangladeshi websites that include government, educational, financial, and NGOs throughout this process to check their SQLi vulnerabilities. As a result of the country's recent focus on digitizing government services, the country already offers a wide range of online services to its citizens, and we wanted to learn more about them. The testing results revealed that the vast majority of the 150 websites tested from various categories are primarily vulnerable to boolean-based blind SQL Injection.""",,"""S. Chakma; I. A.

"""Toward assessing the impact of mobile security issues in pedagogical delivery: A mobile learning case study""","""The hackers' incentive to attack mobile devices is growing along with people's increasing reliance on mobile technology usage. Mobile applications, text messaging and wireless networks open devices up to attack. Despite security risks mobile technologies have been reported to be instrumental in reshaping tertiary education in developing countries. While mobile security threats are a concern and mobile technologies' potential to boost productivity in Higher education increases, little has been done to assess the impact of mobile security risks against utilization of hand-held technologies for learning. This paper argues that mobile security risks have a significant impact on mobile learning adoption. Drawing on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) factors that promote Mobile Instant Messaging (MIM) for learning adoption will be examined by exploring the pedagogical application of WhatsApp mobile software. Stratified random sampling was employed to select 20 interviewees. Findings of this study suggest that mobile security threats negatively affect intentions to use WhatsApp strategy for learning, hence extending the UTAUT.""",,"""A.

"""Closing the revenue gap: Enforcing e-procurement as a complementary strategy to ensure voluntary compliance""","""Tax revenue to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is at a snail paste in developing countries, but in Africa, this is as if a spell cast on growth. According to the Africa Union, Africa loses in excess of $148 billion annually to corruption. This is estimated at about 25% of Africa's GDP. His study aims to employ the scientific study of human behavior in relation to motivation in Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) and compliance theories to advance the understanding of the behavior of individuals operating various business entities, in order to effectively and efficiently implement adaptive strategies that will close the revenue gap. The review was conducted on a wide range of secondary data and materials on relevant theories among other scholarly writings on the subject area. This paper argues that the emergence of cooperative compliance on the African continent is just another version of a normative process that does not satisfy the rational perspective of compliance, only aimed at partially attempting the problem, but not a solution to the whole. This study views cooperative compliance as another plot to fail if government does not employ CAS strategies and policies to address the root cause(s) of corruption. The fundamental argument of this paper is that corruption is not the root cause of revenue leakages in Africa. To address the root cause(s), government should focus on system thinking to advance technological growth and innovations, specifically the expansion of internet infrastructure and accessibility to meet the over 500 billion mobile subscribers in Africa, to transform the continent onto E-procurement that indirectly enforces voluntary compliance.""",,"""D.

"""“Desperate Times Call for Desperate Measures”: User Concerns with Mobile Loan Apps in Kenya""","""The usage of mobile loan applications has proliferated in developing countries. This is due to the ease and speed in which they disburse small loans to users, compared to traditional financial institutions, such as banks, that only offer similar loans based on existing customer relationship or collateral. As mobile loan apps are a relatively new industry, these apps are mostly unregulated and therefore tend to charge extremely high interest rates. Further, they collect and sometimes misuse sensitive user data through the course of verifying customers and ensuring loan repayment, such as users’ contacts and SMS communications through the mobile device permission system. Yet, the reasons for usage as well as privacy concerns with these mobile loan apps in the developing world, and specifically in Kenya, remain largely unexplored. To investigate mobile loan apps, we conducted semi-structured interviews (n = 20) with loan app users in Kenya, and we find that most users generally have privacy concerns, particularly regarding access to their phones’ contacts. However, they often overlook these concerns as this outweighs their need to procure loans. At the same time, we find that users struggle to understand the use of permissions by these mobile loan apps (and mobile apps generally), confirming prior research on comprehension of Android permissions. Our results highlight privacy risks, concerns and behavior with the emerging mobile loan app marketplace in the developing world, and we offer recommendations that can help protect their users’ security and privacy, including the need for transparent communication by these apps on how they collect, use and secure their users’ data.""",,"""C.

"""A suitable telehealth model for developing countries""","""Telehealth allows health care professionals to diagnose and treat patients in remote locations using telecommunication technology. In few developed countries, telehealth has become standard medical practice. Over 10,000 peer review papers have been published during past 20 years supporting the clinical effectiveness and cost savings of telehealth. Unfortunately, telehealth has not been implemented widely especially in developing countries yet. In order to identify the resistance and enabling factors for the implementation of telehealth especially in developing countries, a comprehensive study has been done. This includes communication and application technologies, standard and legal issues, cost and business models, as well as user and key player requirements. The study result shows that technology has become an important enabling factor. Some technologies even have fulfilled the critical requirements such as reliability, user friendliness, simplicity, safety, security, cost effectiveness, connectivity and compatibility. However, without solving related legal issues, implementation of an excellence business model as well as user acceptance, telehealth will be difficult to be implemented in developing countries. A telehealth model with considering those resistances and enabling factors has been developed and will be presented in this conference. The model has been tested in some hospitals and clinics in few developing countries. Test result shows that the model is suitable, cost effective and able to improve the health service quality in developing countries. It is hoped that the developed model can be widely implemented in the near future. This will benefit people in rural areas, developing countries, correction facilities (prison and rehabilitation centre), schools, mobile units, disaster areas, and industrial units (mines).""",,"""E.

"""Analyzing the security posture of South African websites""","""Today, public-facing websites are virtually used across all different sectors by different types of organizations for information sharing and conducting core business activities. At the same time, the increasing use of mobile devices in Africa has also propelled the deployment and adoption of web-based applications. However, as the use of websites increases, so are the cyber-attacks. Web-based attacks are prevalent across the globe, and in South Africa an increase in such attacks is being observed. Research studies also suggest that over 80% of the active websites are vulnerable to a myriad of attacks. This paper reports on a study conducted to passively analyze and determine the security posture of over 70 South African websites from different sectors. The security posture of the local websites was thereafter compared against the top ten (10) global websites. The list of the websites was mainly chosen using the Amazon's Alexa service. The focus of the study was mainly on the security defense mechanisms employed by the chosen websites. This approach was chosen because the client-side security policies, which may give an indication of the security posture of a website, can be analyzed without actively scanning multiple websites. Consequently, relevant web-based vulnerabilities and security countermeasures were selected for the analysis. The results of the study suggest that most of the 70 South African websites analyzed are vulnerable to cross-site scripting, injection vulnerabilities, clickjacking and man-in-middle attacks. Over 67% of the analyzed websites unnecessarily expose server information, approximately 50% of the websites do not protect session cookies, about 30% of the websites use secure communications, in particular for transmitting users' sensitive information, and some websites use deprecated security policies. From the study, it was also determined that South African websites lag behind in adopting basic security defense mechanisms when compared against top global websites.""",,"""J.

"""Leveraging the Technology of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles for Developing Countries""","""The technology of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) renders itself easily to a variety of applications because of their characteristics such as flexibility, quick deployment and cost effectiveness. Developing countries can harness UAV technology for humanitarian and development goals. This paper presents five interesting UAV applications for developing countries and these include disaster management, agriculture, delivery, surveillance of transmission lines and network coverage. UAVs aid the process of disaster management because they can be quickly deployed to take imagery which is used by rescue teams. They offer a cheap alternative to satellites and manned aircraft for agricultural mapping and management. Developing countries are faced with the major challenge of inadequate infrastructure which can be overcome by using UAVs to make especially emergency deliveries. UAVs are more effective at inspecting power transmission lines than manual techniques especially in developing countries where it is expected that the power transmission lines will span over tens of thousands of kilometres. Network coverage can be achieved cost effectively using UAVs for rural remote areas that are neglected by network operators because of their low economic return. This paper also discusses challenges that must be overcome to fully exploit UAV technology for the mentioned applications.

"""Mobile device usage in higher education institutions in South Africa""","""Cyber security threats are on the rise as the use of personally owned devices are increasing within higher education institutions. This is due to the rapid adoption of the Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) trend. In 2014, 92% of students used laptops globally for academic purposes, 44% used tablets, and 68% used smart phones. In addition, 89% of higher education institutions in the United States and United Kingdom allow students, faculty and non-academic staff to access their network using personally owned mobile devices. A great concern is that although BYOD is widely accepted in higher education institutions, security is somewhat lacking. In addition, cyber-security threats have switched their focus to mobile devices. Therefore, the number of new mobile vulnerabilities reported each year has increased. Furthermore, in 2014, 10% of global cyber security breaches took place in the education sector with a total of 31 breaches resulting in the exposure of 1,359,190 identities. This placed the educational sector at the top of the list with the third most cyber-security breaches in 2014, behind the healthcare and retail sectors. A literature survey, together with a single explanatory case study involving a higher education institution in South Africa were used to determine typical mobile device usage in an academic context. As a result of completing the study, it is clear that there is a high demand for the use of BYOD in higher education institutions in South Africa and that BYOD is vital to the academic success of its students. This paper discusses mobile device usage in higher education institutions in South Africa.

"""Developing countries and Internet-of-Everything (IoE)""","""Various global development opportunities have been escalated through the Internet of Everything (IoE) with the potential of progressing Sustainable Development goals - dramatically accelerating and improving lives of millions. The emerging economies of developing countries with minimal investments have crafted a huge array of (IoE) technologies strongly demanding interoperability and interconnectivity that are affordable, scalable and available, significantly improving people's quality of life. Growing number of devices requiring interconnectivity referring to the concept of (IoE) headed beyond sensors, chips, computers and smartphones. The modern replete technology has enabled both synchronous and asynchronous communication without human interaction in many industrial processes, fleet management, stock exchanges, inventory systems and environment monitoring regardless of their extensive deployment. Information Communication Technology (ICT) is a fast evolving industry in developing countries, offering (IoE)'s huge potential of transformation and disruption. The global development challenges have emphasised the need for communication and due to (IoE) advancements, long-standing issues (health care, stock, management, cross-border, technology diffusion etc.) would be surmounted in an affordable and quick manner. The developing countries would turn-around with the help of a long-awaited (IoE) technology aiming at improving their economies and lives of millions of people. The key to increased usage is the interconnectedness of diverse range of devices which formerly were incompatible with each other. The interoperability between devices has rendered (IoE) both practical and possible and in accordance with the international communication standards. Research and industrial organisations have stipulated the formation of a hyper-connected society where tens of billions daily life objects and devices would communicate, forming a global network of smart devices. The successful provision of intelligent and smart devices through (IoE) services leads to challenging security concerns especially in developing countries where communication and devices are cheap but there is a lack of secure (IoE) infrastructures. The current paper would envisage a secure architecture for diversely connected objects within developing countries. A secure configuration methodology of the bootstrapping scheme is proposed as a solution in this paper. The bootstrapping scheme is activated as soon as a new object get connected to an operational network. This method is feasible to secure the devices and avoid data exploitation within developing countries where communication across devices is still lacking protected infrastructures.

This paper begins by analyzing the various cyber threats involved in cyber banking. Secondly, it proposes a cyber-banking security architecture, with the boundary and application security. The boundary security architecture comprises of four components and the application security proposes strategies to avoid vulnerabilities. Lastly this paper proposes a cyber-banking security framework to be adopted by financial institutions.""",,"""T. M. Mbelli; B.

"""Secure and Efficient Mobile Personal Health Data Sharing in Resource Constrained Environments""","""Although personal health record (PHR) systems are widely used in the developed world, little has been done to explore the utility of these PHR systems in the developing world. One of the key reasons behind this is the fact that a lot of areas in the developing world suffer from technological impediments that are a result of poor infrastructure, low literacy, intermittent power connectivity, and unstable bandwidth connectivity. In technological resource constrained environments such as these, deploying standard PHR systems is challenging and so it makes sense to redesign these systems to cope with the environmental limitations in order to offer users a usable and reliable platform. Furthermore, healthcare data is inherently privacy and security sensitive so, in re-designing the PHR system the security and privacy requirements need also be taken into consideration. The idea in this case, is to opt for security mechanisms that offer the same levels of security as is the case in the standard PHR systems that are used in the developed world, but that are also lightweight in terms of performance and storage overhead. In this paper, based on the observation that mobile phone use is widely proliferated in developing countries, we propose an access control framework supported by identity-based encryption for a secure Mobile-PHR system. Results from our prototype evaluation (laboratory and field studies) indicate that the proposed IBE scheme effectively secures PHRs beyond the healthcare provider's security domain and is efficient performance-wise.""",,"""R.

"""A survey of cyber-security awareness in Saudi Arabia""","""Rapid development has been observed in the deployment of communication technologies and the use of the Internet across the globe. Information exchange is the main aspect of use of such technologies in everyday life. Crimes associated with the misuse of information on the Internet are on the increase and are resulting in various losses. Saudi Arabia is one of the fastest developing countries in the Middle East, where the uptake of communication technologies such as the Internet and mobile technologies has risen sharply in recent years. These technologies are relatively new to the region when compared to developed countries. Therefore, the crimes associated with these technologies may be new to the people in the region. This paper investigates the cyber security awareness of the people in Saudi Arabia within different contexts. A quantitative online based survey was conducted to gather information related to cyber security awareness in Saudi Arabia. The study found that, although the participants had a good knowledge of IT, their awareness of the threats associated with cybercrime, cyber security practices, and the role of government and organisations in ensuring information safety across the Internet, is very limited. An application based model to create cyber security awareness in the region was preferred by the majority. The results indicated that, although cybercrime is on the rise, no specific approach is being followed to increase cyber security awareness in the region except for CERT regulations and online information on government websites. Additionally, Chi-Square test results (t(627)=3.85, p=0.013) indicated that Internet skills have an effect on cyber security practices from the users' end and there is an association between skill level and the security measures being implemented by organisations in the region. The study found that there is an immediate need to develop a model to create cyber security awareness in the region in order to combat cybercrime.""",,"""F. Alotaibi; S. Furnell; I. Stengel; M.

"""Challenges of Implementing E-learning for Higher Education in Least Developed Countries: A Case Study on Bangladesh""","""Successful implementation of e-learning is dependent on successful delivery of contents, courses and training via electronic media including the Internet, intranets, extranets, satellite broadcast, audio/video tape, radio, interactive television, and compact disk read only memory. Weaker economy and absence of adequate infrastructure facilities are main obstacles of effective e-learning practices in least developed countries. As a member of least developed countries, Bangladesh has lots of challenges regarding e-learning. This study illustrates technological, psychological, socio-cultural and economic factors that would affect successful implementation of e-learning for higher education in Bangladesh. Unwillingness to change the learning atmosphere, poor level of competency in English, lack of funds and technical resources in universities, lack of confidence to practice computer applications coupled with absence of infrastructure such as electricity and telephone lines in many parts of the country are the most difficult issues to address. A five point scale to measure computer knowledge level and another five point scale to measure the e-learning knowledge for least developed countries are used in the study. The benefits and potentials of e-learning far outweigh its challenges. The paper concludes recommending some measures to resolve these issues by cohesively working together of the government and the private sectors.""",,"""K. Mahmud; K.

"""How Can Fingerprint Improves The Payment Experience of a Drink Vending Machine?""","""Many examples of technology on the payment scheme already help and facilitate transactions in Indonesia such as internet banking, ATM or debit cards, e-money, and also mobile banking. Included on drink vending machine, it is a sale that utilizes machines. Today's commonly, drink vending machines still use coins or smart cards, which based on the Legal and Ethical Experience this factor is still have many weaknesses and threats, that can occur in this payment system. So the payment authentication factor is needed to pay more attention to user experience components, some of which are ownership, privacy, and security.So that in this study, the implementation of the fingerprint authentication scheme was made as an epayment factor based on user experience. This study uses a mixed-method in analyzing every pain problem of the research. Where to conduct exploratory studies through literature review and direct observation in the case of the application of the vending machines, especially in developing countries such as Indonesia. This research shows that the payment authentication system can solve the problem of the risk of system attack, the risk of topping up fails, it can harm the user (R1), if the user loses a smart card, the smart card is at risk of being used by not the owner (R2), if the data on the smart card is cloned, it can poses a risk to the system (R3). The conclusion of the proposed payment system can overcomes the existing problems obtained from the system security testing scenario. In addition, user agreement testing (R4 and R5) are also done by providing a questionnaire comparing the level of satisfaction of the existing and proposed payment systems, the results of this test shows that the user feels comfortable with the proposed payment system.""",,"""S.

"""Supporting Blockchain-Based Cryptocurrency Mobile Payment With Smart Devices""","""The smart device owning rate such as smart phone and smart watch is higher than ever before and mobile payment has become one of the major payment methods in many different areas. At the same time, blockchain-based cryptocurrency is becoming a nonnegligible type of currency and the total value of all types of cryptocurrency has reached USD 200 billion. Therefore, it is a natural demand to support cryptocurrency payment on mobile devices. Considering the poor infrastructure and low penetration of financial service in developing countries, this combination is especially attractive. The high storage cost and payment processing latency are the two main obstacles for mobile payment using cryptocurrency. We propose two different schemes for cryptocurrency mobile payment, one involves a centralized bank and the other one does not require any centralized party. We also provide a solution for the bank to meet KYC (know your customer)/AML (antimoney laundering) compliance requirements when it is involved in cryptocurrency mobile payment processing.""",,"""L.

"""Portable Digital Stadiometer for Assessing the Degree of Childhood Malnutrition in Low-Income Countries""","""Chronic malnutrition is a major concern of low-income countries. Children affected by chronic malnutrition are affected by stunted physical growth, reduced ability to learn, low cognitive development and weak immune system. A new and cheap instrument composed of a digital stadiometer and an Android-based application has been developed to rapidly screen the status of malnutrition of children in low-income countries. The core of the digital stadiometer is Arduino Nano, connected to a time-of-flight sensor capable of measuring the children height. The height data are transmitted by Bluetooth to the Android-based application, which automatically evaluates the degree of children malnutrition by height/age ratio. The proposed instrument was firstly calibrated in a private clinic in Italy, and then tested in Uganda, evidencing an alarming situation: 53% of children were identified as chronically malnourished with 12% of cases affected by severe malnutrition. The instrument was successfully used by local staff who confirmed its great advantages over the previous screening technique based on mechanic stadiometer and manual paper transcription of data.""",,"""S.

"""Cloud computing: Feasibility of developing web-based UNU Casemix Grouper""","""Casemix system is a disease classification system which is developed as a tool to enhance quality and efficiency of healthcare services. The system utilised routinely available information in healthcare settings as the minimum dataset. The UNU-IIGH has devised the UNU Casemix Grouper that is currently being used as the casemix grouping engine in a number of developing countries. In the next stage of development, UNU-IIGH plans to deploy the system using the cloud computing platform. The term “cloud computing” denotes the use of Internet-based computers for a variety of computing application services known as Software as a Service (SaaS). As definitions evolve and refine, cloud computing now implies the move away from centralised computing applications into remote applications running in a “cloud” of computers. Users of cloud computing are not concerned with the inner workings of the remote application and only “see” and “use” the services being requested, without control of the technology infrastructure to make it happen. It is envisaged that through cloud computing, the users of the UNU Casemix Grouper will not be overburdened with the initial capital cost for the infrastructure development required for using the casemix grouper. With cloud architecture, the UNU grouper would be able to support the implementation of casemix system to a wider audience especially in developing countries with limited local IT infrastructure. This will ensure that developing countries with limited development budget and basic IT infrastructure has access to much-needed tools like casemix grouper; as well as introduce much needed financial efficiency and clinical quality to their healthcare system. This paper presents the architecture and development of UNU casemix grouper in cloud computing environment and discusses its strengths, weaknesses and challenges in implementing the programme in the health information systems of developing countries.""",,"""S.

"""Field Surveys for Biomass Assessment in African Savanna Woodlands""","""Most rural and some low-income urban households in southern Africa rely on fuelwood and charcoal to meet their domestic energy demands, targeting specific tree species for their calorific value. The lack of quantitative data on extractable standing woody biomass makes it difficult for energy planners to ascertain the sustainability of exploiting such resources. Large scale estimation of biomass using ground-based methods is both tedious and time-consuming. Optical remote sensing techniques are constrained by adverse atmospheric conditions such as clouds and haze, and in any case survey only the upper surface of the vegetation canopy. Recent advances in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing and Global Positioning Systems (GPS) technologies coupled with geographic information systems (GIS) offer innovative ways to quantify and assess available woody biomass. Tree species heterogeneity in savanna woodlands requires training data with minimal target-to-image noise to distinguish tree vegetation on SAR imagery. The absolute positioning of trees is critical for correlating ground survey measurements with the corresponding aerial photography or satellite positions. The ground truth data is useful for calibrating and validating radar satellite imagery in biomass assessment surveys. GPS offers rapid methods of establishing both control and capturing field data. While Differential-GPS gives highly accurate ground positions, Electronic Distance Meter (EDM) surveying techniques are used to compliment GPS measurements when field conditions are not favourable. GPS accuracy is degraded when receivers are operated under dense tree canopies. Connecting field surveys to national mapping systems or GPS networks allows easy integration of woodland spatial information with data from other sectors. This is constrained by the lack of common reference frameworks. In Africa, a unified African Reference Framework (AFREF) is still in its formative stages and network GPS is not yet fully developed. South Africa is the probably the only country that has a well developed GPS infrastructure. Although commercial GPS base stations are available, the required initial capital investment and annual maintenance charges often limit their use in developing countries. This paper proposes a method which combines rapid static DGPS, EDM topographic surveying and mobile GIS techniques to capture, compute and record absolute positions and vegetation parameters of preferred fuelwood tree species in African savanna woodlands. The proposed method will generate ground-truth data for preferred fuelwood species in selected case study villages under the VW Foundation Biofuels Modeling project, covering Zambia, Mozambique and South Africa.""",,"""C.

"""Framing the digital complexity economy""","""This keynote paper discusses the opportunities and barriers to real economic growth through e-transformation in African economies. Understanding the answer to this question is dependent on how we interpret the question and on where the opportunities for economic growth lie. Interpreting the question: Two decades ago, researchers studied the globalization of the world economy; then they studied mobility and the mobile communications economy. We also study the broadband Internet economy, wireless nomadic access and a few scholars study the cyber economy, including cloud computing and its associated risks, security and contracting issues. Furthermore, we have also studied the knowledge and innovation economies. For countries on the African continent (and other continents), it would be appropriate to study the complexity economy - the interconnected facets of globalization; knowledge, innovation and learning; mobile, wireless and broadband communications; and the shift from relatively simple and basic forms of e-commerce and e-government to the complex e-transformation of all sectors of the economy, from agriculture to manufacturing and knowledge services. I have termed the abstraction of these interconnected thematic areas and perspectives the “complexity economy”, meaning that scholars and practitioners need to give attention to theorizing such an economy with respect to the African continent. Where are the opportunities? If the digital information economy of apps, OTT services, mobile money and broadband Internet can change the economy, it will. But where and how do African economies need to change in the next five to ten years? We will need to the link this discussion to an understanding of what proportion of the economic and social actors on the continent can access the information economy? While mobile access has increased dramatically, too few of the nearly 1 billion population of Africa has Internet access, or broadband Internet access, or mobile broadband Internet access, to drive economic growth in most countries on the continent. Too few e-services and m-services are available in key sectors of the economy such as banking and finance, travel and tourism, education and health. When these sectors undergo e-transformation, the information economy can begin to drive economic growth. In addition to discussing these key challenges, the paper will present a brief overview of Cyberspace and the Internet in Africa, with particular reference to selected countries in North, West, Central, East and Southern Africa, commenting on the issues pertinent to decision-makers, academics and innovators in the complex digital information economy.""",,"""L.

"""A note on modified SET protocol for mobile payment""","""Recently a modified SET protocol for mobile payment (MSET) has been proposed in the literature. MSET claims to be a promising protocol for mobile payment. However, we have observed certain flaws and drawbacks in the proposed protocol. In this paper we discuss those flaws and drawbacks and propose counter measures for the same to ensure secure transaction. The first flaw is that a dishonest client can buy goods from a merchant without paying the actual price of the goods. We also observed that the MSET protocol lacks the Non-Repudiation property of transaction. Further, we would like to mention that the modified SET is using certificate, which is having no use once the symmetric key is distributed. This causes communication overhead for the mobile application. As a result the protocol will be useful only for mobiles with reasonably high processing power.

"""Energy Demand Forecasting and Optimizing Electric Systems for Developing Countries: A Systematic Review""","""Currently, developing countries are experiencing a massive shift toward industrialization. Developing countries lack the technical sophistication and infrastructure to encourage low-carbon and sustainable economic growth because of weak public awareness, regulations, and technology. Developing countries must plan the industrialization process for maximum energy efficiency of production, thereby reducing their CO2 emissions significantly by increasing energy efficiency. This paper attempts to review the current pragmatic methods for forecasting the future load demands from minutes to years ahead in developing countries, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P). Our primary focus is to provide an optimal forecasting model selection strategy for potential researchers and forecasters. Based on the strengths and weaknesses of the different models, we will discuss the most suitable methods to tailor them to multiple applications and scenarios of load forecasting. The comparison elements are Forecast horizons, Spatio-temporal resolutions, factors affecting the load, different dimensional reduction techniques, model complexity analysis, and the MAPE for error analysis. From the results, We have found ANN hybridized with meta-heuristic techniques to be superior in most of the analysis cases. ANN’s ability to handle non-linear data, flexibility, and robustness is why. Consumption data aggregated at the national level can capture trends efficiently.

"""Accident Alert System Application Using a Privacy-Preserving Blockchain-Based Incentive Mechanism""","""In this era of rapid growth of vehicles, the ratio of road accident increases day by day. Nowadays, Traffic incidents are persistent problems in both developed and developing countries which result in huge loss of life and property. No one in this world is ready to gaze what's happening around them. Nobody cares even when an accident occurs. This paper provides an innovative solution by developing an Accident Alert Message System using an Android Smartphone Application that can be used from the accident zone. The application uses GPS technology for location mapping and sends an alert and notification of an accident. The generated accident alert message is endorsed by the nearby registered users who also witness the accident to ensure the increased reputation of the message. Based on the endorsement of the message, the system will instantly transmit the location of the accident to the nearby emergency services. In this case, users usually lack the enthusiasm to generate or endorse alert messages because they might fear that their privacy will be breached. At the same time, users do not benefit from generating or endorsing alert messages which also makes them lack the enthusiasm or motivation to respond to messages. In order to provide a solution to resolve these issues, this paper presents a novel privacy-preserving Blockchain - Based Incentive Mechanism for Accident Alert Message System. The main objective of the paper is to encourage the users to generate and endorse accident alert messages from the accident zone without revealing the user's identity. Also, some incentives to the users are paid to the message generators and endorsers and the transactions get stored based on the Blockchain technology; hence the privacy of the user is preserved. Our proposed system ensures the reliability of alert messages without revealing the privacy of the user and is reliable and efficient in the non-fully-trusted environment.""",,"""G. S. Praba Devi; J.

"""TempNet: Application of Wireless Sensor Network for Industrial Temperature Monitoring with IoT Integration""","""Temperature measurement and control in different points of different industrial machines are one of the most important parameters for smooth and reliable operations. Most of the traditional temperature monitoring systems in the industries of developing countries are based on either wire or thermocouple or infrared thermal scanner. In this paper, the distributed temperature is measured within the range of -40°C to 1350°C using K type thermocouple via a wireless sensor network (WSN). To construct WSN, zigbee is used. The network coordinator is connected with the main processing unit which is interfaced with the computer showing the temperature in graphical format. The graphical user interface(GUI) is developed using MATLAB. The main processing unit also uploads the data to the cloud server. For security purpose, the data is encrypted at the router side by Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm and decrypted on the coordinator side. An android app that is synchronized with the cloud server is developed to visualize the temperature data in a remote android device. Received Signal Strength Intensity (RSSI) based results are also analyzed on which it is found that at 600m distance the RSSI value is about -67 dBm and no data is lost or corrupted.""",,"""N. I.

"""Design of vital sign monitor based on wireless sensor networks and telemedicine technology""","""Heart attack is a term generally used for medical conditions like Acute Myocardial Infarction, Cardiac Arrest, and Atrial Fibrillation. Before the onset of such an abnormal condition, there are symptoms which generally we avoid to care. Even after the attack the patient needs continuous monitoring and care. But all this needs to be at a very affordable cost, thus developing a Quality, Secured and Cost effective health monitoring system becomes the need of the hour. The Proposed Vital Sign Monitor is based on a wireless sensor network and telemedicine technology. This system is designed to be a mini patient monitoring system which measures the vital parameters like ECG, Heart Rate and Respiration Rate. The system uses Bluetooth technology which is embedded with the sensor for faster transmission. The transmitter unit is designed to be an Android based smart phone through an application that connects to wireless networks using the best source of connectivity which is either a 3G network or IEEE 802.11 i.e. Wi-Fi based transmission. The proposed system implements the IEEE 1073 standard for medical device communication. The remote system consists of a cloud server where the centralized monitoring takes place. The expert in the remote center can view all the patient data and at the same time can witness full duplex real time streaming video if required, so that the expert can take a confident call. If required the expert can ask the individual in the spot to take indispensable action and in critical cases can accelerate an ambulance for attending the emergency case. The power utilized by the entire system is low due to the intelligent algorithms that control the system. The principles of green computing and signal processing applied in the system help in the development of a green smart system. The vital sign monitor designed can improve the reach and affordability of healthcare in developing countries affected by various socioeconomic crises.""",,"""N. S. Shivakumar; M.

"""On Optimal Crowd-Sensing Task Management in Developing Countries""","""In developing countries, crop field productivity is particularly vulnerable to spreading diseases, including viruses and fungi. This is mostly due to the lack of skilled plant pathologists as well as to the scarce fund and poor infrastructure (e.g., roads, power and water lines) availability. The PlantVillage project through its mobile application named Nuru provides an AI digital assistant to recognize plants and their diseases through image analysis. Through the use of Nuru endowed smartphones, farmers can participate in a mobile crowd-sensing framework to improve their crop production. The crowd sensing framework also contributes to early detection of the outbreak of spreading diseases across geographical regions, and consequent adoption of appropriate countermeasures to ensure food security. As devices are often granted in a limited number by countries' government or charities, we propose a Farmer to Farmer (F2F) cooperation to achieve the required Quality of Information (QoI) for the system. In particular, only a selected crew of farmers receive smartphones to monitor their own farm as well as some other farmers' one.

"""GSM Based Low-cost Gas Leakage, Explosion and Fire Alert System with Advanced Security""","""Gas leakage and gas cylinder explosion is a regular problem in today's world, especially in developing countries. If the gas leakage can't be detected fast and no action is taken, may lead to explosion and cause severe damages to life and environment. The previous leakage detection systems only use alarms for warning. There is nothing about the protection. In this paper, a system is proposed that can detect not only gas leakage, it can detect explosion, and fire as well. And can take some protective steps. It is equipped with gas sensor to detect the leaked gas and flame sensor to detect the explosion and fire. It has exhaust fan system to clear the leaked gas and solenoid valve to inlet the water or carbon dioxide gas (CO2) if explosion and fire occurs. The explosion security system response individually when there is only a fire with no relation to gas leakage. If any incident occurs, that information is sent to owner through wireless media, a display shows the alert message and buzzer makes the alarm. It is equipped with Global System for Mobile communications (GSM) modem as wireless media to send information to owner through Short Message Service (SMS). This ensures preventive actions immediately even in the absence of people on-site. A prototype of this system has been developed and tested with Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) and Fire as well. The experimental results show that the system can detect the gas leakage, explosion and fire. It is also able to take protective steps quickly. This life saving system is low-cost and useful.

When the age of thin clients becomes popular in developing countries with the profits of security, reliability, less vulnerability, maintainability and sustainability have been moved to the usefulness of their inevitable good behaviors. Interactive applications can be caused some bottlenecks of performance delay over thin client server network. The safest technique to access the smooth performance is the explanation and reintroduction of overclocking method which can be used efficiently for the system under some special considerations which was not warranted by manufacturer's rating.

"""Stand Alone Distribution Feeder Inter Area fault Location Identification System for Indian Utility""","""India is a developing country and the major power behind developing the country is its incredible power handling as well as dispensing capability. The number of utility consumers per unit area is increasing day by day which in turn leads to transmission system complexity. Also, the distance which each feeder should be fed is exponentially becoming lengthier/loaded compare to that of year's back. Such a system is expected to experience various faults at any time and therefore Smart Systems should be developed/incorporated in order to manage such complex systems. The work presented here looks into the inter-area fault location which exactly locates the fault origin area. As mentioned earlier, the distribution side is comparatively much longer with added complexities; the identification of fault location is difficult for the lineman during fault cases. The different faults which occur in a transmission system are line to ground fault (L-G) line to line fault (L-L) line-line-line to ground fault (L-L-L-G) and leakage fault. In such cases, the lineman has to inspect the particular feeder from one end to the other for identifying the fault which is a tedious job in all sense. Here we propose the new system to identify the exact location of the fault i.e., by using co-ordinate operation of an adaptive sensor and relays. A communication controller platform is designed to detect and communicate the contingency cases and then report it immediately to local remote station. An adaptive voltage sensor is installed at feeders and is coordinated well to obtain the line parameters during contingencies. This data is fed to a micro controller which processes the data and if a fault occurs the exact location of the fault will be sent to an Android Operating System. From the system, by using an Android Application, precise fault location is displayed. This can also be used as a future data collection method for load variation, power factor variations etc. in a transmission system.""",,"""P. Thomas; A. G. Reji; A. Mathew; D.

"""Vulnerability Analysis of Online Banking Sites to Cross-Site Scripting and Request Forgery Attacks: A Case Study in East Africa""","""Web applications are prone to several attacks. Two common threats are cross-site scripting attacks and cross-site request forgery. With internet banking becoming more popular in East Africa, the level of security that online banking services offer has become an increasing concern. This paper presents an analysis of the safety of these applications used by many unsuspecting customers seeking convenience and determines ways to detect and prevent these attacks from taking place. We assumed that if people with a technical background in IT and information security are vulnerable to CSRF and XSS attacks, the public would be even more vulnerable. Out of 96 users, 35 answered our survey, 53.1% of the respondents said they do not check the URLs of online banking websites they visit to ensure they are not on a phishing site. Secondly, only 36.4% of users considered the security implications of clicking on links in emails or even on banking websites all the time. Based on the interviews done, testing and analysis conducted, there is a clear indication that Internet banking users are vulnerable to XSS and CSRF. Notably, close to 50 % of the Internet banking users we interviewed reported that they do not receive ample tips from the banks regarding security issues to look out for when transacting online. The findings from this research help make recommendations to banks and users to ensure that future online banking transactions are done more securely.""",,"""G. Buah; S. Memusi; J. Munyi; T.

"""Deep Learning Model for Image-Based Plant Diseases Detection on Edge Devices""","""Plant diseases are a major threat to global food security. Infection of plants by pathogens can have serious consequences on plant health which inherently affects human health. With more than 80 percent of agricultural production done by smallholder farmers who depend on healthy crop yield for their livelihood, yield loss of more than 50 percent due to pests and diseases is reported. Currently, infectious diseases reduce the potential yield by an average of 40% with many farmers in the developing world experiencing yield losses as high as 100%. The widespread distribution of smartphones among crop growers around the world with an expected 5 billion smartphones by 2020 offers the potential of turning the smartphone into a valuable tool for diverse communities growing food. One potential application is the development of mobile disease diagnostics through machine learning and crowdsourcing. With the help of state of art technologies like deep learning and cloud computing, the same can be achieved on a real-time basis. With the help of Convolutional Neural Network architectures, a system is proposed that focuses on detection and identification of the plant disease with a mere click of leaf picture and provides solutions.""",,"""C.

Some prominent research funding organizations stated that nearly ten to 30 percent of the medicines are fake in developing countries. This have now become a major worldwide problem. One of every ten medicines are either fake otherwise don’t follow standard of drugs in developing countries and making the situation worse there. It is very tough to standardize safety regulation of medicines because of the rise of internet pharmacies. Counterfeited drug passes through various distributed complex networks. So, it is hard to detect the counterfeited medicines. For distributed complex networks, the fake drugs get chance to get into the genuine drug supply chain. The security of the drug supply chain has become the utmost concern of public health sector. To get drug supply chain records which are secure, a drug management system is developed using Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain platform in this work. This developed system solves the problem by performing transactions of drug records on a blockchain platform to create a digital, smart drug supply chain. To limit the access to electronic drug records, a smart contract is launched.

"""Memhans: an Assistive Device for Dementia Patients""","""Worldwide, around 50 million people have dementia with symptoms including loss of memory, difficulty in thinking ability, issues with problem-solving and usage of language. About 1.2 million people provide specialised care for dementia patients throughout the world, but the number of trained dementia caretakers are low in India. Traditionally, the focus of medical research has been to find a plausible cure for dementia, while solutions to ease the lives of dementia patients, their caretakers, and their families are often neglected. This paper aims to design and develop a bio-engineering based assistive device- Memhans for patients suffering from the mild and moderate stage of dementia through the help of a case study, intensive design methodologies and prototyping skills. The prototype is an RFID based module integrating a GPS chip (for location tracking) with Bluetooth and a smartwatch app which has the function of relaxing the patient with music. It also provides notifications to the patient, their family, and their caretaker via respective smartphone apps and provides for a contextual understanding by `object and person identification'. This device provides the patient with assistance in daily activities, safety, person and object identification, and most importantly helps them live a dignified life. It also gives a sense of security and eases the minds of the caretaker and the patient's family. This device is cost-effective and is developed for a large number of impoverished patients who reside in developing countries like India.""",,"""U. Sait; V. D. Ravishankar; T. Kumar; S.

There exists a huge potential market which is yet to be exploited. To capitalize on this market, however, it is important to know the potential use of the 3G mobile networks in Indonesia as a developing country. One of the potential uses of the 3G mobile networks is 3G mobile multimedia services. To understand the current status and potential of 3G mobile multimedia services use among Indonesians, it is important to explore the reason why some Indonesians have, and others haven't yet, embraced 3G mobile multimedia services, and perceiving these services. In this article, we present key findings of our research that addresses these objectives. Our study reveals that although many respondents aware of the 3G technology, only 47% of respondents use 3G mobile multimedia services. Even those who use 3G mobile multimedia services have perceived only a limited use of 3G mobile multimedia services. The service that they mostly use is the internet access followed by video call and mobile TV. The services such as video email, mobile video, movie preview, and video surveillance are not much used. 53% of respondents do not use 3G mobile multimedia services though some of them have 3G services support mobile phone. The main reasons they cited for non using 3G services are high cost of the services, no compatible hand devices, family and friends do not use 3G mobile multimedia services, and 3G applications and services are not easy to use.""",,"""Indrawati; S.

"""An Approach for Developing Integrated Decision Support System Model for Optimizing Contracting Process of Public Procurement in Pakistan""","""Public procurement expenditure accounts for 45 to 65 percent of a national budget, often equating to at least 15-20 percent of a country's gross domestic product and these estimates are even higher for developing countries like Pakistan. Due to weaknesses in current operational procedures of Public Procurement in Pakistan, it is approximately paying between US$ 31 to US$ 62 Billion more annually than it should be for procuring of goods, works and services. The inefficiency in operations of public procurement like long lead time of process results in funds lapse of allocated budget, which simply indicates the inefficient public funds utility. As the research scope is limited to public procurement of goods so the problem of inefficient public funds utilization will amplify in form of long term forecasts, high level of inventories, high costs, high cost and slow response to end user requirements. Since Public funds are scarce in developing country like Pakistan, so to warrant the efficient use of the resources this research work lays the basis for developing a technical and business model for optimizing the operational delay in public procurement process especially the phase of contracting, as in this phase most time is consumed and it's the most critical of all other phases, especially in public procurement of goods. This will help in developing a model in a software application form, which will act as a decision support system to procurement management to optimize the contracting phase for reduction of wastes in public procurement process, saving millions in government expenditure, act as feedback on future evaluation and positively impact socioeconomic development in Pakistan.""",,"""M.

"""Uncovering Price Puzzle in the Wheat Economy of Pakistan: An Application of Artificial Neural Networks""","""Wheat is at the epicenter of global food security. Extreme wheat price volatility can contribute to broader social risks in terms of food security, human development and have a significant influence on farmers' incomes in the coming years especially in developing countries like Pakistan. Wheat is not only the major staple crop of the country's food security, but it also contributes about 10.3% in agriculture which accounts for 2.2% of domestic GDP. However, the presumable intensification in climate change and macroeconomic instability is reputed as a threat to wheat price stability nationwide. Against this backdrop, this research develops a precise wheat price puzzle forecasting model using the Long- Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM-RNN) - an application of Artificial Intelligence. LSTM-RNN are proficient in handling non-linear complex systems owing to their special LSTM nodes. An assessment of the planned framework with a handful of prevailing models is also discussed. Results showed that LSTM-RNN outperformed in terms of accuracy and uncovered that wheat prices will progressively swell and shrink by 2030, which will pose menaces to the whole economy.

"""Classifying Swahili Smishing Attacks for Mobile Money Users: A Machine-Learning Approach""","""Due to the massive adoption of mobile money in Sub-Saharan countries, the global transaction value of mobile money exceeded  $\$ $ 2 billion in 2021. Projections show transaction values will exceed  $\$ $ 3 billion by the end of 2022, and Sub-Saharan Africa contributes half of the daily transactions. SMS (Short Message Service) phishing cost corporations and individuals millions of dollars annually. Spammers use Smishing (SMS Phishing) messages to trick a mobile money user into sending electronic cash to an unintended mobile wallet. Though Smishing is an incarnation of phishing, they differ in the information available and attack strategy. As a result, detecting Smishing becomes difficult. Numerous models and techniques to detect Smishing attacks have been introduced for high-resource languages, yet few target low-resource languages such as Swahili. This study proposes a machine-learning based model to classify Swahili Smishing text messages targeting mobile money users. Experimental results show a hybrid model of Extratree classifier feature selection and Random Forest using TFIDF (Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization yields the best model with an accuracy score of 99.86%. Results are measured against a baseline Multinomial Naïve-Bayes model. In addition, comparison with a set of other classic classifiers is also done.

Alternatively, spatiotemporal remotely sensed data especially vegetation index have been widely applied in land cover and crop type mapping in U.S. and Europe where land parcels are relatively large. The crop type mapping in the context of Africa remains a challenge due to the small plot size and mixed farming practice. In this research, we develop a machine learning application to map crop types of smallholders in South Africa using Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing with spatial-temporal remotely sensed datasets. The model can successfully map major crop types and crop combinations in the region. The validation shows that R-squared is over 0.7 when characterizing crop types in the region.""",,"""Z. Guo; A.

"""Biotechnology and food production""","""Agriculture is expected to feed an increasing population, forecasted to reach 8 billion by 2020, out of whom 6.7 billion will be in developing countries where the carrying capacity of agricultural lands will soon be reached. Fifteen years ago, plant biotechnology comprised only a few applications of tissue culture, recombinant DNA technology and monoclonal antibodies. Plant biotechnology applications must respond to increasing demands in terms of food security, socio-economic development and promote the conservation, diversification and sustainable use of plant genetic resources as basic inputs for the future agriculture of the Region. Food security is defined by FAO as the access by all people at all times to the food needed for a healthy and active life. Public and private institutions should play a key role to create or strengthen National Programs to guide efforts toward the real production needs and food security. National Programs should identify objectives and priorities in each country, in order to promote regional collaboration, find financial support and facilitate the transfer of appropriate biotechnology and biosafety norms to the producers by promoting the application of valid results.""",,"""N.

"""Information Diffusion and Economic Development""","""In many developing countries there remains a limited view on the socioeconomic status of the population, owing to the high cost associated with detailed and comprehensive surveying. This situation has encouraged a number of researchers to attempt to exploit alternative sources of data in order to derive estimates, including mobile phone data, which offers a rich depiction of the social dynamics of a population. Meanwhile, from the level of the individual to the city, access to information has been posited as an important factor in determining prosperity and economic development. In this paper we explore this relationship by simulating the flow of information through a mobile phone call graph in two sub-Saharan countries. We find a strong relationship between a location’s average wealth and its access to information as determined by the simulations in one country, and a weaker correlation in the second country. This finding adds to recent evidence that mining patterns from mobile phone data represents a viable means to estimate poverty in places where traditionally derived estimates are lacking. We further investigate the impact of various factors on the empirical results in order to explain the variation between the two countries.""",,"""C. Smith-Clarke; L.

"""A lightweight mobile e-procurement solution for rural small scale traders implemented using a living lab approach""","""Proliferation of mobile technologies usage in emerging regions represents an opportunity for leveraging the benefits of mobile ICTs by rural communities. Despite the availability of reliable mobile connectivity infrastructure and a relatively high penetration of mobile devices in rural areas of emerging economies such as South Africa, the use of mobile phones is primarily for voice communication purpose. Data communication is limited to SMS exchange and recently WhatsApp amongst users who are literate to engage in such services. The foregoing suggests that capabilities offered by mobile data communication are not exploited enough in further contributing to leveraging the ICT literacy levels of rural dwellers taking into account their needs, preferences and competencies. This paper presents a lightweight mobile e-procurement application that was implemented for small scale retailers in a rural area of South Africa to conduct business efficiently and cost-effectively. The application's overall goal was to address challenges faced by rural small scale retailers during stock replenishment. The paper demonstrates how the challenges were addressed by exploiting capabilities offered by mobile web and context of the operating environment including users' profiles.

"""Smart Contracts in the Global South""","""While blockchain applications are at a nascent stage of development in developing countries (referred to as “Southern countries” in this article), they are already having significant economic, political, and social impacts.1 Writing and implementing contracts are one area that is likely to benefit from blockchain. Specifically, smart contracts, which execute automatically when certain conditions are met, can address some of the deficiencies of existing problems associated with contract laws and their enforcement in Southern countries. In many cases, the real challenge is in the interpretation of the contract rather than the breach by a party. Often, an uncertainty about the meaning of the terms in a contract presents questions of interpretation.2 Since smart contracts are enforced by software codes, many of the interpretation-related problems are not likely to occur in such platforms. Among the major benefits, smart contracts can dramatically reduce costs associated with verification and enforcement. Other advantages include higher speed, precision, efficiency, and transparency. A key challenge in this is how Southern countries can benefit from blockchain and its potentially disruptive application in smart contracts. In this article, we attempt to assess the potential of blockchain-powered smart contracts in Southern economies vis-a`-vis traditional contracting mechanisms.""",,"""N. Kshetri; H. Besada; R. S.

"""E-School: A web-service oriented resource based e-learning system""","""The education systems of 21st century are characterized by increasing dependence on various modes of electronic facilities. E-learning is one such facility that can ensure education for everyone without considering their geographical locations. However, due to very high initial cost for infrastructural development, developing countries like Bangladesh are unable to get the total benefits of e-learning. Therefore, the education facilities and standards in rural and remote areas are noticeably dissatisfactory, compared to the urban areas of those countries. Reusing of existing resources and infrastructures to implement an e-learning system can reduce the overall operational cost of the system, hence can be ideal for developing countries to exploit various e-learning facilities. Considering these issues, in this paper we propose to design a web service oriented resource based system named “E-School” for the primary, secondary, and higher secondary education system of Bangladesh. This e-learning system will provide identical course materials, useful multimedia tools, integrated databases, and help desk for students. We design E-School as a platform independent system so that it can be accessed using any cell phone, PDA and computer from anywhere with mobile network coverage.""",,"""A. Sultana; I.

This paper provides a synthetic overview of the current research and application of AI technologies for AAiW. It analyzes the literature in the AAiW context, with a special focus on three themes (health, participation and security) under the WHO's active aging framework. It further explores how the intelligent technologies help older people stay healthy for longer in the workplace, and organizations better deal with an aging workforce.

A list of these would include threats from weather, natural disasters (although some of these, such as earthquakes, are not new threats, or brought about by human activity), disease and loss of adequate water of food supplies. These threats have not escaped the notice of governments, and although there is discussion over who is responsible and what should be (GEO) established by the first Earth Observation Summit in July 2003 which declared the need for “timely, quality, long-term, global information as a basis for sound decision making”. The second Earth Observation Summit in April 2004 agreed to a Framework which established the basic principles for preparing an Implementation Plan for a Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). The plan also calls for support to countries, particularly developing countries, in their national efforts to collect data, use satellite and remote-sensing technologies for data collection and to access, explore and use geographic information. All of these intergovernmental initiatives come on top of the on-going activities of the United Nations, CEOS and IGOS, (The Integrated Global Observing Strategy) and ICSU and the efforts of international societies such as ISPRS, ICA, FIG. The paper sets out to review some of these activities and to address the issue of how organizations such as ISPRS can contribute to them. Such discussion must go alongside the technological developments which have occurred in the past 10 years or so. We have seen much more Earth observation data become available and the convergence of the nature and application of satellite data with airborne data, so that either could be used in the generation of digital elevation models, (DEMs), for example, or for mapping.

"""Pervasive / ubiquitously connected""","""To the eyes of the urban beholder, pervasive / ubiquitous computing seems to be achieved. However, not so in the eyes of the rural person. Apart from mobile phones, not much computing seems to go on in rural areas of Africa. This key note, postulating from a definition of Internet, puts the case for the need of African drive and further exploration of both theoretical and practical concepts in and around the pervasive computing paradigm and pinpoints unique, rural angles which play a role in reshaping the landscape of African societies. Challenges are deducted from long term experience in sensitization, introduction and operations of information and communications technologies in rural Zambia[1][2][3]. Although quantitive aspects play a role, a multitude of qualitative and interlinked factors feature prominently[4]. Constrains in rural areas involve unique contextual, geographic, and cultural ingredients. In an drive to sustainability, appropriate interventions must include sensitivity to such a mix of context and culture. Contextual ingredients include aspects like orality, traditional leadership structures and regulatory practice, human resource and agency, and practicalities like housing, roads, distances, electricity, business, and cost levels. Culture encapsulates history, sense of solidarity, relatio economics[5], a focus on human relations, and a sense of security. Such issues are fundamental, substantial, and materially different then those in contemporary western context from which pervasive computing has emerged. The keynote calls for further transdiciplinary research and evaluation which is sensitive to these rural challenges, and is required if all of Africa is to receive proper inclusion and participation in pervasive computing in the wake of pervasive/ubiquitous connectedness.""",,"""G. van Stam""",2011,10.1109/ICPCA.2011.6106462,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6106462,IEEE Conferences

"""Micronutrient deficiencies in the developing world: An evaluation of delivery methods""","""Malnutrition is a serious problem in developing countries, particularly among children under five and women of childbearing age. Expectant and nursing mothers are especially vulnerable to micronutrient deficiencies. Effects of micronutrient deficiencies such as weakened immune systems, overall morbidity, and stunted childhood growth are reversible in the critical age group of 0 to 5. Providing children with the essential nutrients lacking in their diets during infancy is essential as it can lead to long-lasting health benefits. Many solutions have been researched and implemented to increase micronutrient intake in the diets of people in developing nations. Implementation of the solutions have ranged from national policies such as the mandatory fortification of certain food products and educating rural communities about improving nutrition levels, to the in-home application of micronutrient fortification powders. The spectrum of solutions has strengths and weaknesses; however, few, if any solutions have been successful at decreasing nutrition deficiencies on a macro scale. This article presents a comprehensive review of academic studies detailing different methods of delivering nutrients to individuals in developing countries. The results of this review are categorized and synthesized into a framework describing the approach, range and success of different strategies to help vulnerable groups meet their micronutrient needs. Understanding this framework will help in identifying gaps in current efforts to address micronutrient deficiencies and improve the current integration techniques into settings with insufficient resources to satisfy dietary needs of populations.""",,"""D.

"""Upper mantle shear wave velocity structure beneath the East African plateau: evidence for a deep, plateauwide low velocity anomaly""","""The shear wave velocity structure of the upper mantle beneath the East African plateau has been investigated using teleseismic surface waves recorded on new broadband seismic stations deployed in Uganda and Tanzania, as well as on previously deployed stations in Tanzania and Kenya. Rayleigh wave phase velocities at periods between 20 and 182 s, measured with a two-plane wave method, have been used to create phase velocity maps, and dispersion curves extracted from the maps have been inverted to obtain a quasi-3-D shear wave velocity model of the upper mantle. We find that phase velocities beneath the Tanzania Craton and areas directly north and west of the craton are faster, at all periods, than those beneath the Western and Eastern branches of the East African Rift System. At periods <50 s, the western branch is slower than the Eastern Branch, but at periods greater than 50 s, this relationship is reversed. Anisotropy is found at all periods, with a generally north-south fast polarization direction. The shear wave velocity model shows a seismically fast lithosphere (lid) beneath the Tanzania Craton to depths between 150 and 200 km. The fast velocities in this depth range extend to the north beneath the Uganda Basement Complex and to the east beneath the northern Tanzania divergence zone, indicating that these regions together form a rigid block around which rifting has occurred within weaker mobile belt lithosphere. The Eastern and Western branches are slower than the craton at lithospheric mantle depths, and both branches show variable structure in the upper 200 km of the mantle, with the lowest velocities found beneath areas of Cenozoic volcanism. At depths greater than ~225 km, a low velocity anomaly is present beneath the entire East African plateau that may extend into the mantle transition zone. Velocities in the low velocity region are reduced by ≥ 10 per cent relative to lid velocities, and if attributed only to temperature variations, would represent an unrealistic thermal perturbation of >400 K. Consequently, it is likely that the velocity reduction reflects a combination of thermal and compositional changes, and also possibly the presence of partial melt. The width and thickness of the low velocity anomaly is greater than typically expected for a plume head and is more easily attributed to an upward continuation of the lower mantle African superplume structure into the upper mantle.""",,"""A.

"""Intelligent Sensors based Waste Disposal system for Smart Cities""","""Municipal solid waste administration has loomed to be a considerable threat faced by environment conservation departments in developing countries. In the present scenario, waste administration is outlined by feeble collection mechanism and deficient canopy of the compilation system. Imprudent management of ruins creates an unhygienic environment and leads to many health issues. An intelligent waste administration system is built to overcome these problems. The major purpose of the planned structure is to implement a smarter way of managing waste using an intelligent sensor. The sensor helps in identifying the quantity of garbage in the trash bin and real-time information collected from the various dustbins located at different places. This system can be implemented with the thought of smart cities in mind. The drivers would make use of an android application to find the shortest and fastest path to collect the garbage. Once the garbage is collected the information would be updated on the web page. The system would even ensure that there is no waste thrown around the trash bin. The intelligent sensor would make a beeping sound if any person negligibly throws it around the trash bin and not into the trash bin. This system ensures a clean and hygienic environment with optimum resources.""",,"""C. Shetty; B. Dhananjaya; Deepa; N.

"""ICT solution architecture for agriculture""","""Agriculture is an important sector with the majority of the rural population in developing countries depending on it. The agricultural sector is confronted with the major challenge of increasing agriculture production to feed a growing and increasingly prosperous population in a situation of decreasing availability of natural resources. Factors of particular concern are water shortages, declining soil fertility, effects of climate change and rapid decrease of fertile agricultural lands due to urbanisation. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) in agriculture have the potential to increase the efficiency, productivity and sustainability agriculture by providing information and knowledge sharing. In this paper, we seek to illustrate the contribution of ICT to food security and sustainability agriculture in developing countries. We argue that developing solution architecture (e-agriculture framework) to expose farmers to the much needed agricultural information (i.e., preharvest and post harvest information, pricing, weather conditions etc) can boost agricultural productivity. We show that such a framework must accommodate the dynamic trends in ICT tools, applications, adoption and usage.

Ad-hoc Mobile Collaborative Community (MCC) has been proposed as a solution to address these hurdles. MCC enables two or more persons to aggregate their mobile phone/PDA network channels for collaborative data transfer across the Internet. These channels may be heterogeneous and are characterized with frequent Quality of Service (QoS) fluctuations. Further, data to be transferred may contain multiple streams each having distinct, possibly conflicting security and QoS requirements. These factors make scheduling of data over multiple channels, a challenging task. In addition, battery and processing power limitations of mobile nodes imply that scheduler should be energy and processing cost efficient.

The proposed SMS based mobile banking scheme provides opportunity to every client of a financial institution to use modern facilities available nowadays via internet banking. The key advantage of our scheme is that the users do not need any sophisticated cellular phone or internet connectivity within the mobile handset. They can get major services, like balance enquiry, balance transfer between authenticated customers, and bill payment without going to the bank physically and saving the precious time. Security at the level of internet based communication between the mobile server and the banking server, which is beyond the control of the clients, is a crucial issue to be handled. In view of providing a high level of security, in addition to voice authentication, the digital audio watermarking technique is employed.

"""Identity management for e-government Libya as a case study""","""Governments are strengthening their identity (ID) management strategies to deliver new and improved online services to their citizens. Such online services typically include applications for different types of permissions, requests for different types of official documents and management of different types of entitlements. The ID management scheme must therefore be able to correctly authenticate citizens and link online presence to real world identities. Many countries, in particular in the developing world, are currently introducing national ID management schemes for the first time. While most of these countries have paper based records, many of these are regionally based and few of these have been consolidated, so these records may contain incorrect, incomplete, inconsistent or redundant information. In this paper, we explore the design space for national ID management and online authentication schemes, in this context. In particular, we propose a simple model for issuing national ID numbers that satisfy these goals and use this model to examine two different ID management schemes implemented in Libya, which allows us to compare different approaches to national identity management. The two schemes were implemented within a fairly short time, so we may assume that the cultural, social, educational and technological factors remain unchanged. This allows a direct comparison of objectives and means. Based on this examination, we evaluate the current Libyan ID number system with respect to the identified objectives. Our evaluation of the two Libyan NID schemes show that if National Identity Management does not fully meet the requirements identified in our simple model, then it may be vulnerable to various forms of online risks such as impersonation and identity theft attacks. Considering online crime, during the design of an Identity Management system, is especially important in developing countries, where such crimes have not previously existed in the society.""",,"""O.

"""Improving the information security of personal electronic health records to protect a patient's health information""","""The electronic collection of patient information is a common practice across healthcare organisations in South Africa. Patients are encouraged to manage and control their own health data and information through the use of personal electronic health records (PEHRs). However, as this is a new type of electronic health record, there are concerns that must be addressed before patients make use of the technology. One of these concerns relate to using mobile devices to manage PEHRs, as patients fear that their health data may be breached due to the mobility and security concerns of these devices. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the information security controls that health care providers must put in place to protect PEHRs accessed from a mobile device. An inductive research approach was used which included an extensive literature review, while a thematic analysis of the data was used in identifying, analysing and reporting patterns within the data. The conceptual m-Health privacy framework was used to identify the 10 privacy principles for the mobile health platform and compared with the three distinct information security threats for the mobile platform. The study found that the data in transit was not as well protected by the framework, while the individual and database of the health care organisation was better regulated.

"""We've Looked at Clouds from Both Sides Now""","""Cloud Computing is a versatile technology that can support a broad-spectrum of applications. The low cost of cloud computing and its dynamic scaling renders it an innovation driver for small companies, particularly in the developing world. Cloud deployed enterprise resource planning (ERP), supply chain management applications (SCM), customer relationship management (CRM) applications, medical applications and mobile applications have potential to reach millions of users. Cloud deployed applications that employ mobile devices as end-points are particularly exciting due to the high penetration of mobile devices in countries like China, South Africa and India. With the opportunities in cloud computing being greater than at any other time in history, we had to pause and reflect on our own experiences with cloud computing - both as producers and consumers of that technology. Our interests and attitudes toward cloud technology differ considerably for each side of the cloud-computing topic. As producers of cloud-like infrastructure, much of our interest was on the technology itself. We experimented with algorithms for managing remote program invocation, fault tolerance, dynamic load balancing, proactive resource management and meaningful distributed application monitoring. As consumers of cloud computing however, our focus switched from interesting technology to usability, simplicity, reliability and guaranteed rock solid data stability. With an eye to the many cloud articles in the recent news, we have to ask, is cloud computing ready for prime time? After reviewing stories about current cloud deployments, we conclude that cloud computing is not yet ready for general use, many significant cloud service failures have been reported and several important issues remain unaddressed. Furthermore, besides the failures and gaps in the current cloud offerings, there is an inherent flaw in the model itself. Today, the cloud represents an opportunity for a client to outsource hardware/software function or program computing cycles. The missing piece is responsibility outsourcing - today something found only in IT Outsourcing contracts. This missing piece represents an essential component of a cloud offering. Without it, cloud consumers are left without any real reassurances that their data is safe from failures, catastrophe or court ordered search and seizure. In this paper, we explore the different viewpoints of cloud computing. Leveraging our experiences on both sides of clouds, we examine clouds from a technology aspect, a service aspect and a responsibility aspect. We highlight some of the opportunities in cloud computing, underlining the importance of clouds and showing why that technology must succeed. Finally, we propose some usability changes for cloud computing that we feel are needed to make clouds ready for prime time.""",,"""T. J. Lehman; S.

"""SPOT: A Low Cost Intelligent Parking System for Urban Malls""","""Manual searching for vacant parking spaces in shopping malls is a tedious process, especially during the weekends and public holidays. It is rather troublesome for consumers to drive around without any directions in search for an empty parking space. Previous studies have confirmed that majority of the drivers experience difficulties in finding a vacant parking space in multilevel car parks and often spend more than 10 minutes searching for parking lots on weekends and public holidays. Current solutions available are probably expensive to implement in terms of hardware and software requirements for shopping malls in developing economies such as Malaysia. Furthermore, the process of payment of parking fee at an Autopay machine is not only bothersome but avoidable. Although leaving a car park may not be as tedious as finding a vacant parking lot, it is still considered a time-consuming activity to most drivers. If given the chance, most people would choose to avoid the trouble of walking to an Autopay machine due to finding incessant long queues or shortage of change at the machine. Advanced societies have adopted Touch`n'Go system which is more convenient than the conventional Autopay system. However, developing economies like Malaysia are still using the manual parking as well as Autopay machine.

So far, several mHealth applications have been developed and deployed in the field, but many of them do not systematically address the security and privacy issues involved. As sensitive information is stored, exchanged and processed in these systems, issues like privacy, confidentiality, integrity, availability and authentication must be dealt with accordingly. In this paper, we analyze the challenges in securing Mobile Data Collection Systems deployed in remote areas and in low-budget settings, and discuss how one can provide an adequate security solution for such systems.""",,"""F.

"""A secured electronic transaction scheme for mobile banking in Bangladesh incorporating digital watermarking""","""Nowadays internet-based banking is getting popularity because of its several advantages, such as ease of operation and virtual monetary activities, i.e., client's physical presence at different bank locations is no more required. However, because of scarcity of accessibility at different locations, cost, and slow speed, number of people using internet communication is a small percentage of the mobile phone users, especially in the developing countries. Moreover, security in internet-based banking is still a major concern. Most of the financial institutions have their own domain and offer web-based transaction facilities. In this paper, we propose a scheme to utilize the internet based existing banking facility via short message service (SMS) available in mobile phone technology without having the internet connection. In view of ensuring a high level of security, we introduce two-level security scheme: voice verification and digital watermarking.""",,"""S. B. Alam; H. M. D. Kabir; M. N. Sakib; A. B. M. R.

"""The development of a mobile information system to assess the food security of rural communities in South Africa""","""While South Africa has the means to be food secure, poverty and unemployment cause 20% of households to be food insecure, mostly in rural areas. Little is known about key factors that influence food security, such as the sources of food of rural households and the relationship between local food production and dietary quality. To this end, a study was commissioned by the South African Water Research Commission (WRC). A quantitative data collection tool was required to collect data related to food security and rural diets. The initial paper-based survey process was error-prone, hence a mobile application was introduced for electronic data capturing. This study concerns the development process of the mobile data capturing system. It is shown how, through a number of development iterations, the system led to significant improvements in the nutrition project's data capturing process. The study demonstrates the value of a responsive IS development process that caters for local needs and constraints, and is hence able to provide appropriate technology to support food security decision-making in South Africa.""",,"""C. van der Merwe; M.

"""A Study on the Performance Metrics of the Universal Filtered Multi Carrier Waveforms for 5G""","""Over the past few years, wireless communication has contributed to the economic and social growth of both developed and developing countries. Cellular networks have become an essential part of the daily lives of billions of people worldwide, a trend that is expected to continue. Orthogonal Frequency division Multiplexing (OFDM) is a modulation technique used in 4G. OFDM have some drawbacks like side band leakages and high Peak to Average Power ratio (PAPR) issues. With the advent of Internet of Things (IOT) and the move towards user centric processing makes the OFDM techniques more unfeasible. On the other hand, various multicarrier techniques are found in the literature, but each of them have major drawbacks. In this study we have introduced Universal Filtered Multi Carrier (UFMC) which is a modulation technique that can be adapted with fifth generation (5G) of mobile networks. We have compared peak to average power ratio (PAPR) of UFMC and OFMD. The simulation results show that, UFMC demonstrated significantly lower PAPR for QAM 16 and QAM 64. However, OFDM remains good choice when the Modulation technique is QAM 4 and QAM 256. This marks UFMC is advantageous over OFMD in terms of application for 5G communications.""",,"""B. O. Ahmed; A.

"""Using Mobile Moodle to enhance Moodle LMS accessibility and usage at the University of Dar es Salaam""","""Over the last decade, there has been a remarkable increase in the adoption and use of learning management systems (LMS) in sub-Saharan Africa in a bid to improve the quality of on-campus delivery as well as increasing access to education through blended and distance learning. Despite the increased adoption of LMS in the region, their potential has not been fully exploited as relatively few users tend to use them, thereby not justifying the high infrastructure investment costs. The continued penetration and adoption of mobile phones amongst users in the region presents an opportunity to find ways of making LMS accessible to users via mobile phones. However, there are relatively few attempts to enhance accessibility and usage of LMS into users' mobile phones especially in sub-Saharan Africa. This article aims at sharing experiences of configuring and using Mobile Moodle to enhance Moodle LMS usage and accessibility via mobile phones at the University of Dar es Salaam. Through analyzing log of two selected courses, it was revealed that the majority of students used Course View and User List features to read course notes and to check for their fellow students respectively. In addition, students indicated that the Mobile Moodle was easy to use and enable them to accomplish learning activities more quickly through a questionnaire that was distributed to elicit their opinions about the Mobile Moodle.

"""On privacy calculus and underlying consumer concerns influencing mobile banking subscriptions""","""The advancement of technology in mobile devices places South African (SA) banking institutions in unique positions to leverage these advancements into innovative value added services. Mobile banking is one such innovation that has afforded banking clients the ability to, amongst other services, view bank statements, pay bills, and transfer money. Despite a growing trend in mobile banking service offerings by SA banks, privacy and security issues are still considered a concern. The paper conceptualizes the underlying concerns by bank clients regarding the adoption of mobile banking services. Privacy Calculus Theory (PCT) has been used as a theoretical lens to explain the cognitive process involved when a potential mobile banking subscriber is presented with mobile banking technology solutions. The paper extends PCT by abstracting the risk/benefit trade-off psyche held by SA bank clients. The paper attempts to explain, using PCT, the bank clients' cognitive process and willingness to subscribe to mobile banking services. Quantitative research method has been used for this purpose. Purposeful sampling that targeted SA bank-account holders was applied. Empirical results show that the South African banked consumers' psyche is largely influenced by the utility of a technology (mobile banking service) and interestingly, privacy and security play a lesser role in this trade-off.""",,"""K.

"""A simple integrated smart green home design""","""Smart home systems were introduced to autonomously control appliances, lights and other services based on the current state inside homes. Smart home systems are designed for a wide band of applications such as healthcare, power management, safety and security. In Egypt, we are suffering from an electrical power shortage because the production is not sufficient for the actual consumption. In addition, there are some isolated areas not covered by the National Grid. Because of this persisting challenge, the need for finding solutions arose. Egypt is a developing country with limited resources, consequently economic and power saving focused solutions are needed. In this paper, a simple integrated design of a smart green house is introduced as a solution for a common Egyptian home to save the consumed power from the National Grid. This design has two main pillars: First, a smart system that controls the power consumption through monitoring the activity in the home to save the power as much as possible. This system comprises of a wireless network of controllers. Each controller monitors and controls a specific area considered a separate zone. These zone controllers exchange the current data and control parameters with a master unit, which provides supervision and control of the entire system. In addition, the system can be monitored and configured locally through a wall mounted touch screen or remotely using a mobile phone or web interface. Second, a solar power supply system equipped with a two degree of freedom sun tracker to partially or fully power the loads and hence reduces the power consumption from the National Grid. The solar system is integrated with the smart supervision system through a wireless link to the master unit.""",,"""A. D. Asham; M. Hanaa; B. Alyoubi; A. M. Badawood; I.

We extract high-level features based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and learn the mapping between the features and PM2.5 by support vector regression (SVR). Given a captured image, we can estimate the PM2.5 value in real time. With the estimated PM2.5, we can estimate the depth of scene using sparse prior and nonlocal bilateral kernel. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the same accuracy of PM2.5 estimation as commodity measurement devices, and estimates the accurate depth information that is even better than the “ground-truth” captured by a laser in the no-haze condition.""",,"""J.

"""An IP geolocation method based on rich-connected sub-networks""","""Recent years have seen a rapid growth of location-aware applications such as targeted marketing, restricted content delivery and location-based security check. Although existing delay-based IP geolocation techniques work well in some developed countries, the assumption of a strong delay-distance correlation that they often rely on may fail in many developing countries for poor network connectivity. To obtain more accurate delay-based IP geolocation results in poor-connected networks, an IP geolocation method based on rich-connected sub-networks is presented in this paper. At first, the network connectivity of one particular network is measured. Next, if the network is poor-connected, the method will divide it and search rich-connected sub-networks based on properties such as ISP and location information of probing hosts and landmarks. Then, based on the discovered rich-connected sub-networks, landmarks and probing hosts are deployed and selected to measure data such as delay, distance and topology, etc. At last, the location of the target host is estimated by modifying the processes of existing delay-based IP geolocation techniques based on selected landmarks and probing hosts. The experiments which cover 30 provinces and 3 major ISPs of China show that the proposed method can find corresponding rich-connected sub-networks and significantly improve the performance of existing typical delay-based IP geolocation techniques in an actual poor-connected network.""",,"""S.

The aim of this article is to present an insightful understanding of the demand-side predilections of South Africa's lead-users in such contexts. We assimilate the theories of Usage Control, (UCON), the Theory of Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), and the Theory of Perceived Risk (TPP) to explain predilections over technology. We demonstrate that constructs derived from these theories can explain the general demand-side predilection to tinker with mobile banking services. A quantitative approach was used to test this. From a sample of South African banking lead-users operating in Gauteng province of South Africa, data was collected and analysed with the help of a software package. We found unexpectedly that, lead-users predilections to tinker with mobile banking services was inhibited by perceived risk. Moreover, male lead-users were more domineering in the tinkering process than female lead-users. The implication for this is discussed and explained in the main body of work.""",,"""K. Njenga; S.

"""A systems engineering framework: Requirements analysis for the development of rural microgrids""","""Microgrids have been identified as a key instruments in solving energy security, environmental sustainability and energy equity problems faced by developing countries. Furthermore, the opportunity exists for these countries to lead the way in terms of microgrid technology due to the lack of preexisting conventional large-scale generation and inherent support infrastructures found in more economically advanced countries. In order to arrive at a sustainable solution for practical application, the social, environmental and technical challenges must be addressed simultaneously. However, the vast majority of research in this area deals with technical challenges in isolation and there is no practical framework available for contextu-alised development of microgrids. This paper presents a systems engineering framework for assisting with the development of sustainable microgrid solutions for remote/inaccessible and rural areas. The framework deals with initialisation of the technical process in the life cycle of a microgrid system.

"""Conceptual Model of E-Voting in Indonesia""","""Some countries have adopted the technology of electronic voting into their democratic processes. Some of them successfully implemented e-voting in their elections, but some countries failed to transform traditional paper-based voting into a technology-based automated voting system. Indonesia is a developing country that carries out general elections every five years. The vote was conducted to elect presidential and vice-presidential candidates, national and regional legislatures, and members of the local representative council. Reducing errors and speed up the counting process are some of the electronic voting benefits. Electronic voting also eliminates the root cause of the controversies in every election, which is a vote that is deemed invalid or doubted, thus it still raises doubts, especially on the security, confidentiality of voter data, and ease of use of the system. This research aims to discover the readiness of the implementation of the e-voting system in Indonesia by conducting a quantitative survey and propose state-of-the-art electronic voting system architecture that is suitable for application in Indonesia. Our investigation shows that most of the respondents are ready to use the e-voting system.""",,"""D. I. Sensuse; P. B.

"""Challenges in providing integrated traveler information in a developing country environment""","""With information and technology becoming such a vital commodity in everyday life, it can be argued that informed travelers are the key to successful future transportation services. This study investigated the need for the provision of integrated traveler information in a developing country environment like South Africa (SA). However, because of the nation's lack of integration and the tumultuous state of its transportation industry, the realization of extensive traveler information is complex. It is recognized that the development of a multimodal transportation system is needed in providing integrated traveler information. The relating challenges and the applicable considerations in attaining such an integrated system were researched. Following from this, a generic sequential framework that facilitates multimodal data integration and traveler information as a precursor to a fully integrated multimodal system was developed. In this framework four focus areas, related to the implementation requirements of the application environment considered, were identified. These focus areas are based on the premise that current technological evolvements need to be exploited in order to breach the missing intelligent link between the various application environments. The establishment of such a concise framework and the associated steps in attaining multimodal information will go a long way towards providing the impetus, and eradicate the barriers, in achieving sustainable traveler information services. Ideally, SA will be able to empower a better transportation service that spans across the nation's social barriers.""",,"""C. B. Struwig; S. J.

"""Evaluation of configuration plans for DGs in developing countries using advanced planning techniques""","""Many developing countries have emphasis on distributed generation (DG) technology for their generation expansion planning. The planning considerations and judicious choice of attributes are dictated by prevailing conditions. The attributes considered are capital costs, energy not served per annum, and profits from injecting power into the grid at peak load, all of which are important for a developing country. The uncertain futures considered are three possible loading conditions, which can be low, medium and high. Different scenarios (plans) are generated by various combinations of configurations. DGs can be configured as stand-alone mode, hybrid operation, or micro-grid formation with or without grid connection. With the increased complexities in DG planning options along with the multiple attributes to be accounted, more sophisticated techniques other than conventional economic analysis are needed to arrive at correct decisions by decision makers. The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is used for obtaining relative weights in an objective way. Further, the statistical method like interval-based multi-attribute decision making with tradeoff analysis is used for shortlisting the feasible plans and identifying the most appropriate plan. It is proposed to use the weights obtained from AHP for finding the performance efficiencies in data envelopment analysis (DEA) for evaluating the plans. A new composite utility function is proposed to resolve cases where performance efficiency is insufficient for evaluation in DEA application. The sample system is derived with reference to a rural electrification scheme in India. The assessment of plans is presented and discussed.

The resulting increase in flexibility, diversity, and complexity is both an opportunity and challenge for ICT practitioners to shape this evolution for the benefit of developing countries and marginalised communities. A conceptual framework is developed to describe the weaknesses of a centralised, top-down approach to ICT development in being able to leverage flexibility and manage complexity towards a more inclusive information society. We extend the framework by proposing an alternative approach based on a pragmatic form of localism, involving decentralised participation with national and global linkages.

"""Risk Management in Construction Projects in the South African Mineral Processing Industry""","""Construction projects in mineral processing plants in South Africa have high failure rates despite the availability of many risk management processes, tools and practices to project managers. This industry application paper investigates the effectiveness of risk management in mineral processing projects. The mining and mineral processing industry is one of the world’s most uncertain and hazardous industries and in recent years South Africa has experienced its fair share of economic, political and industrial challenges. Despite these challenges, a recent survey revealed that many African mining executives remain focused on the importance of securing new projects to ensure future production and growth. These new projects include new and complex technologies aimed at increasing productivity and efficiencies in the extraction and processing of minerals. South African mining industry risks unique to the region include knowledge and skills shortage, quality of education, prevalence of HIV/AIDS, power outages, political involvement and increased talks on nationalization, insufficient expenditure on R&D projects and increased unionisation. The effective management of risks is essential for project performance especially in this particular industry, due to significant investments required as well as the combination of both construction and mining/mineral processing risks involved. The study uses qualitative research methods to collect and analyse data from project management practitioners involved in construction projects in mineral processing plants. Operational, financial, legal and compliance, political and SHE risks are identified as major risks that need to be effectively managed to reduce project failure. The actions and behaviours of leaders and followers in projects are found to precipitate project failure. These include limited risk knowledge and competence, complacency and poor collaboration with team members. Risk management processes are also noted as a problem as they tend to be complex and impractical. Finally, the lack of comprehensive application of formal risk management along all the stages of the project life cycle is found to have a negative effect on risk management. The study recommends the development of a risk management culture, project team training and the reassessment of the effectiveness of currently used risk management tools in order to improve project success rate.""",,"""F.

"""Seeing the forest for the trees: A systems approach for rural water and sanitation service management and operation""","""This paper presents the preliminary stages of a research program centered on the development of a systems approach to water and sanitation service management and operation. Given high failure rates of rural water and sanitation infrastructure in developing countries, the sector now points to “systems approaches” as ways for practitioners and service stakeholders to understand the economic, institutional, political, environmental, and technical externalities that drive sustained service provision. Unfortunately, systems approaches and techniques often rely on expensive or inaccessible forms of quantitative data and are inaccessible to local stakeholders. Moreover, limited evidence exists for the true benefits of a systems approach in supporting sustained service provision. This research aims to fill these gaps by developing and refining an accessible participatory systems mapping approach to modeling factor interaction as a means to improve identification and characterization of leverage points for improved policy and practice for water and sanitation services. Coupled with this, application of computer models of the water and sanitation systems will help to identify areas of technical vulnerability that, alongside stakeholder interviews, will help prioritize which technical interventions, if any, would be most effective.""",,"""J.

""" $ALC^{2}$ : When Active Learning Meets Compressive Crowdsensing for Urban Air Pollution Monitoring""","""As metropolises develop, air pollution has become a serious problem, especially in developing countries like China. Many governments and researchers have devoted themselves to tackling and solving this problem. With the proliferation of smartphones, mobile crowdsensing is becoming a promising paradigm for monitoring large-scale environmental phenomena. In a practical crowdsensing system, incentives should be provided to encourage the participation of rational smartphone users, because it incurs various costs on users to collect sensing data. However, monitoring fine-grained air pollution in a large urban area based on crowdsensing will lead to high payments, which makes designing an efficient incentive mechanism a challenging problem. Fortunately, compressive sensing (CS) has been proved as an effective technology to reduce the amount of collected data via exploiting the spatial correlations among sensing data. In this article, we employ CS in the air pollution monitoring application, in which only a sampled set of locations are selected to collect data and provide incentives to the participants, and air pollution concentrations in unselected locations are inferred via CS. We propose an active learning scheme, which iteratively selects valuable locations to collect sensing data. Moreover, an expectation maximization-based algorithm is designed to detect the contexts in which sensing data are collected, and an efficient incentive mechanism is provided to encourage users with low costs participating. Comprehensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate the performance of our proposed scheme.""",,"""T. Liu; Y. Zhu; Y. Yang; F.

"""Structuring an advanced technology degree program in a developing country""","""Technology consists of the implementation of scientific principles into tools that allows us to solve problems. As new technology emerges, the capacity to solve harder problems increase. A developing country can choose either to buy technology or develop its own. The latter has the advantage of creating an in-house understanding of both the scientific principles and the creation of new technology process. Nevertheless, it may turn to be a long cycle where the more likely outcome could be a brittle reverse engineered copy of the desired technology. In this document, we present a proposal to structure an academic degree program that may help to create the technology needed to solve problems in industry. In this program, the students courses and thesis work, is related to a problem in industry. Indeed, the curricula are defined both in terms of the student background and a problem in industry. This approach has the advantage of shortening the time between technology conception and application. Under this framework, an industry taking part in the program works with an academic institution in the solution of its specific problems; the academic institution counts with the industry as added research facilities; and researchers have students to work with, ample budget to do their investigations and the possibility to do a great impact with their results. The problems that surge with our approach include how to match existing expertise in academy and the needs in industry, and the inadequacy of the academic periods with the tight time-schedule generally present in industry.""",,"""P.

"""CDMA Deployment in Developing Countries: What Went Wrong in Nigeria?""","""Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) is a spread spectrum technology that divides a finite radio frequency spectrum to allow multiple users access at the same time using codes to accomplish multiplexing instead of time or frequency division. It is a direct competitor to the Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) which is the most widely deployed wireless cellular technology. However, despite being a robust network platform that can offer services enhanced voice quality, broader coverage and stronger security than the legacy GSM networks, it still has not achieved global penetration. The technology has experienced a steady diminished in developed nations and did not survive in most of developing countries, where it has already failed. This paper examines the issues and challenges that affected the penetration of CDMA technology in developing nations, with emphasis on Nigeria. Finding from this study revealed that failure of CDMA networks in Nigeria are traced to un-favourable policies, poor operating environment, limited reach and coverage, roaming and roaming charges, stiff and aggressive competition. Other challenges include technological issues, paucity of funds, poor corporate governance among others.

"""A standard-driven communication protocol for disconnected clinics in rural areas""","""The importance of the Electronic Health Record (EHR), which stores all healthcare-related data belonging to a patient, has been recognized in recent years by governments, institutions, and industry. Initiatives like Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) have been developed for the definition of standard methodologies for secure and interoperable EHR exchanges among clinics and hospitals. Using the requisites specified by these initiatives, many large-scale projects have been set up to enable healthcare professionals to handle patients' EHRs. Applications deployed in these settings are often considered safety-critical, thus ensuring such security properties as confidentiality, authentication, and authorization is crucial for their success. In this paper, we propose a communication protocol, based on the IHE specifications, for authenticating healthcare professionals and assuring patients' safety in settings where no network connection is available, such as in rural areas of some developing countries. We define a specific threat model, driven by the experience of use cases covered by international projects, and prove that an intruder cannot cause damages to the safety of patients and their data by performing any of the attacks falling within this threat model.

"""Multi-Modal Diagnosis of Infectious Diseases in the Developing World""","""In low and middle income countries, infectious diseases continue to have a significant impact, particularly amongst the poorest in society. Tetanus and hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD) are two such diseases and, in both, death is associated with autonomic nervous system dysfunction (ANSD). Currently, photoplethysmogram or electrocardiogram monitoring is used to detect deterioration in these patients, however expensive clinical monitors are often required. In this study, we employ low-cost and mobile wearable devices to collect patient vital signs unobtrusively; and we develop machine learning algorithms for automatic and rapid triage of patients that provide efficient use of clinical resources. Existing methods are mainly dependent on the prior detection of clinical features with limited exploitation of multi-modal physiological data. Moreover, the latest developments in deep learning (e.g. cross-domain transfer learning) have not been sufficiently applied for infectious disease diagnosis. In this paper, we present a fusion of multi-modal physiological data to predict the severity of ANSD with a hierarchy of resource-aware decision making. First, an on-site triage process is performed using a simple classifier. Second, personalised longitudinal modelling is employed that takes the previous states of the patient into consideration. We have also employed a spectrogram representation of the physiological waveforms to exploit existing networks for cross-domain transfer learning, which avoids the laborious and data intensive process of training a network from scratch. Results show that the proposed framework has promising potential in supporting severity grading of infectious diseases in low-resources settings, such as in the developing world.""",,"""G. A.

"""Shear wave model of southern Africa from regional Rayleigh wave tomography with 2-D sensitivity kernels""","""Rayleigh-wave phase velocities are computed at the period range of 20–167 s in southern Africa from a two-plane-wave (TPW) tomography method using 2-D, Born approximation sensitivity kernels. These phase velocities are compared with the results of the TPW method using Gaussian sensitivity functions and the correlation between the two methods is good up to 100 s. The correlation coefficient becomes less than 0.5 at periods greater than 111 s, indicating significant finite-frequency effects at long periods. The correlation of phase velocity between adjacent frequencies increases with period for inversions using the 2-D sensitivity kernels, while such a systematic trend is not observed for inversions using Gaussian sensitivity functions. In addition, low phase velocity anomalies at long periods (111–167 s) are better and more consistently imaged from inversions using 2-D sensitivity kernels. To account for finite-frequency effects and improve resolution, the 2-D sensitivity kernels are therefore recommended in regional TPW tomography.A 3-D shear wave model is developed from the phase velocities obtained in southern Africa. The new model confirms the existence of a fast mantle lid underlain by a low-velocity zone revealed in a previous model constrained from the TPW method using Gaussian sensitivity functions. One new feature in this model is the vertical alignment of a shallow low-velocity anomaly with a deep high-velocity anomaly at the western Bushveld province. The alignment provides new evidence to support the interpretation of the slow anomaly as the result of high iron content from the Bushveld intrusion and the fast as a more depleted residual mantle. A low-velocity channel at the depths of 220–310 km from the Namaqua–Natal Belt to the northwest of the Kaapvaal Craton is also imaged. It suggests that the hot asthenosphere beneath the mobile belt can migrate into the craton area through a weak channel and produce thermal disturbance at the base of the craton. Further more, low-velocity anomalies from 100 to 140 km in the 3-D model agree well with the localities of kimberlites erupted at 65–104 Ma in the Kaapvaal Craton. This observation supports that kimberlites are generated in the lithosphere by thermal disturbance and provides additional evidence for the depth extent of mantle xenoliths.""",,"""A.

"""Rebuilding the Internet Exchange Point in Uganda""","""Uganda is a land locked country in South East Africa. It is separated from the Indian ocean by Kenya to the east and Tanzania to the south. It is separated from South Atlantic by the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west. Uganda's connection to the Internet is overland to Mombasa, Kenya where the Seacom cable installed in 2009 connected Mombasa to Europe with a capacity of 640 Gb/s and the World Bank funded Eastern Africa Submarine Cable System (EASSy) undersea fibre optic cable connects Eastern Africa to South Africa and Europe with a capacity of 1.4 Tb/s. [1]. Additionally until recently Uganda was dependent upon a single overland link to Kenya via Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Limited (UETCL) power lines whereas today there are a number of options such as the Seacom cable fibre cable completed in 2015. During the 2010 FIFA World Cup Final a terrorist attack on the Kyandondo Rugby Club in Nakawa, Kampala brought all Internet Service Providers (ISP) in Uganda off-line as the rugby ground sits directly underneath the UETCL power lines bring Internet services from Kenya. This leaves Uganda at significant disadvantage regionally and to-date the technology industry has tended to converge at Mombassa and Nairobi as well as in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Recently however as the modern Internet services require Global Service Providers (GSP) to get closer to the end-user so they can avail of lower latency, higher bandwidth applications, the justification for serving all of South East Africa from data centres in Narobi, Mombassa, Dar es Salaam and even from South Africa is becoming less valid. In order to facilitate the deployment of locally hosted content and reduce the country's reliance on international cables, additional capacity was required at the country's primary local interconnection point, the Uganda Internet Exchange Point (UIXP). UIXP is currently developing its infrastructure to support a larger membership encompassing growing demand from both ISPs and Application Service Providers (ASP). This paper serves to outline the developments that are being put in place to take UIXP from a local Internet eXchange Point (IXP) supporting local ISPs and e-government services to the next level where it is in a position to support GSP Content Delivery Networks (CDN) and therefore pave the way for the next phase of development of the Internet in Uganda.""",,"""D.

"""Prototype of household inverter using dual-axis solar tracker to overcome shortage of energy""","""Energy crisis is one of the biggest problems in developing countries. There is a big gap between generation and demand of Electric energy. Since the deposits of Non-renewable energy are limited, the only solution is to use Renewable energy. Solar energy which is present in abundance can play a vital role to overcome the energy deficiency. The potential of solar voltaic energy can also be exploited for averting environmental pollution and managing atmospheric emission. This research paper provides a proposal for design of an inverter using dual axis solar tracker installed on rooftop. The paper focuses on presenting the structure and application of a microcontroller based dual axis solar tracker which tracks the direction of the solar radiation thereby adjusting the movement of solar panel accordingly. This facilitates the sun to remain perpendicular to the PV panel throughout the day which makes the total energy received to be increased by 50-60%. The energy hence received gets stored in a chargeable battery. This battery has an inverter attached to it so that whenever there is a power-cut, the stored energy may be used to light up the appliances. The stated research aims at minimizing the dependence on power from national grid station to meet the daily energy requirements in both urban and rural areas of the country.""",,"""S. Gangwar; A.

"""Efficient Image Processing Technique for Authentication of Indian Paper Currency""","""Now a days due to the development in color printing technology the rate of counterfeit notes production and distribution is increasing. This is a massive problem, faced by almost all the countries. It affects the economy, sine it compromises the security of the real economy. Such counterfeit currencies are used to fuel nefarious motives, usually involving terrorist activities. According to the research, developing countries like India have been impacted by this very negatively. Even after the steps taken in 2016 to remove the counterfeits, by executing the demonetization of 500 and 1000 rupees bank notes in India the counterfeits of the new notes have begun circulating. This is due to the highly advanced technology adopted by the counterfeiters which makes the tracking of these counterfeit notes hard. This has become a very critical issue and the negative impact due to the counterfeit currency keeps rising. The only one solution for this problem for a common man is to detect the fake currency, by using the fake currency detector machine. These machines are used in banks and large scale business, but for a small business or for a common man these machines are not affordable. This paper gives the complete methodology of fake note detector machine, which is affordable even for a common man. By implementing the applications of image processing techniques we can find out whether the currency notes are fake or not. Image processing technique consists of a number of operations that can be performed on an image, some of which include image segmentation, edge detection, gray scale conversion etc. The proposed system will have advantages like simplicity, reliability and costs less.""",,"""R.

"""MAS-DEWS: A multi-agent system for predicting Africa's drought""","""Droughts continue to be the number one hydro- and meteorological natural disaster inflicting Africa. In the last decade alone, the Continent contributed 55% of the world's droughts and 64% of deaths emanating from these disasters. With over 24% of her population affected, Africa accounted for 47% of people affected by droughts in the same period. Given that rain-fed agriculture is a major source of food in most African countries, the droughts have contributed to the acute food-insecurity; this may explain why 35 of the 45 poorest countries are in the Continent. There is consensus that drought early warning systems that contextualize culture and risk, have higher chance of succeeding in reducing vulnerabilities and building resilience. A homegrown drought early warning system designed around cheaper wireless sensor weatherboards, mobile phones and weather lore has the ability to address Africa's unique challenges and opportunities. However, integrating these diverse components requires some level of intelligence that only found in multi-agent systems. We present the design, implementation and evaluation of a comprehensive system made up of seven sub-systems that are linked up together by intelligent agents that were implemented using the Java Agent Development.

"""Solar PV powered mobile cellular base station: Models and use cases in South Africa""","""The huge costs of operating a mobile cellular base station, and the negative impact of greenhouse gasses on the environment have made the solar PV renewable energy source a sought after. In addition to cost and environmental factor, abundant supply of solar radiation in Southern part of Africa, and the drive to reduce the emission of carbon dioxide by the year 2020 and to improve the quantity of power supply are also part of many incentives to power communication base station systems with solar PV cells. To this end, solar PV powered base stations have become important integration into a mobile cellular network. Thus, this article exploits the use of solar PV powered mobile cellular base station systems in South Africa. It was also found through this feasibility study that the country has a solar radiation between 4.5 kWh/m2 and 6.5 kWh/m2. Also found was that the use of solar PV cellular base station will lead to about 49 % reduction in operation cost compared to using the diesel generating sets. Therefore, this article, as a feasibility study, explore the use of solar energy capacity of South Africa towards powering the mobile cellular base station.

Well structured national innovation systems run across all the innovation value chain: from the transfer of ideas or inventions, to their commercialization as high value and differentiated products or services, producing high economic and social impacts In developing countries, the circumstances are quite different. There are weak liaisons, low trust and poor association between economic generators (companies) and their supporting institutions (government, federations, banks and academies). Regions are not electronically prepared (e-readiness) to support the infrastructure required for the effective formation of clusters (e-readiness). Innovation is not perceived as an asset, and high value entrepreneurship is not a common finding in the entrepreneurial profiles of most professionals. There are no world class industrial enabling conditions, nor high value core capabilities, and the digital economies are creating large digital development divides instead of business opportunities. In general, the economic gap between rich countries and poor ones widens every day. To help alleviate this situation, we have developed the WIT Model (Wealth creation through Innovation and enabling Technologies). This model has been designed to create the necessary and sufficient enabling conditions and core capabilities to empower developing regions to transform their scarce resources and hostile conditions, into attractive regions with competitive industries and innovative companies, capable of producing great added and differential values, strongly interrelated with their regional social capital, so that they can compete globally as extended networks of value, and share their economic value among their local communities.

"""A Secure Context-aware Content Sharing Kiosk for Mobile Devices in Low-Resourced Environments""","""Despite the explosion of mobile subscribers in Sub-Saharan Africa, there is still a challenge of delivering the appropriate content to the users taking into account of various Internet connectivity constraints and emerging security requirements. Although technologies for information sharing are steadily growing, the communication infrastructure that provides the backbone of third or fourth generation connectivity requires a lot of capital and is often limited by geographical coverage. Motivated by these challenges and constraints, this paper presents a design of the Secure Context-aware Content Sharing Kiosk, an enhancement to the previous Content Sharing Kiosk approaches with support for secure online and offline content distribution and sharing. A hybrid of a role and lease-based security and privacy model was embedded in the design to control distribution of information across different recipients. The lease-based security and privacy model combines the strengths of the role-based security and privacy models by allowing mobile content users to have control over the content sharing through pre-defined conditions of content leasing. Such conditions include time and location thereby enabling users able to lease out information to other users on the network. Upon expiry or violation, the leased information expires. In order to renew access to such information, users are able to request for the renewal of the lease from the content owner.

"""Why electronic and not electromechanical ELCBs ?""","""South Africa's 40 years of experience in the manufacture and application of sensitive earth leakage protection devices, together with the global experiences covering millions of installed units over several decades have resulted in a better understanding of not only the advantages, but also of the limitations of ELCBs. In Europe, where electromechanical ELCBs are used almost exclusively, the question of reliability of installed ELCBs has become a subject of major concern and attention. The popular hype regarding perceived reliability of electronic components was not sufficient to prevent the major South African manufacturer, some five years ago from changing their entire ELCB range from electromechanical to electronic technology ELCBs. The improvements in reliability that resulted from this decision are complemented by their freedom from safety performance limitations often found in lower specification electromechanical earth leakage circuit breakers.""",,"""V.

"""Study of SMS air interface delay in strong and weak signal environments""","""SMS has the potential to support time-sensitive applications that provide access to information and services in developing countries. In this paper we present a series of tests of SMS air interface delay in strong and weak signal environments. We initially establish time delay baselines for three different sizes of SMS messages. Comparing different size messages in strong and weak signal environments tells us that the time delay in a weak signal environment increases in comparison to the strong signal on average by 0.5 seconds and the standard deviation doubles. Introducing fast fading by making the sending device mobile, the average air interface delay increases slightly but the standard deviation triples compared to the stationary case. The distribution function of the time delay has thicker tails than a normal distribution and we develop a novel distribution model that provides a good fit to the empirical data and provides useful insights about system performance.""",,"""S.

"""Megawatt scale energy recovery in the Rankine cycle""","""It has, in recent times, become the focus of national and international political pressure to reduce the impact of climate change [1]. The amount of CO2 that is released to the atmosphere now has legislative and tax implications with CO2 emitters around the world in both developed and developing countries having to implement CO2 reducing technologies to reduce costs and maintain profitability [2]. We aim to exploit the Peltier effect exhibited in semiconductor devices to create an enthalpy capture device using the significant amount of energy rejected by such a power plant. A thermoelectric device applied in its heat pumping mode, enables the redirection of energy released in the condensation process. We aim to prove that using the thermoelectric device in a particular configuration enables the preheating of water returning to the boiler (feed water).

"""Promoting e-participation in County Governments: A case of a county government in a developing country""","""Public participation is considered an important pillar in governance in Kenya as demonstrated by the way it has been severally enshrined in the constitution of Kenya 2010 as well as the County Governments Acts. Despite such policy and regulatory frameworks for public participation being in place, county governments in Kenya are still characterized by poor public participation in governance and government processes. Additionally, despite several studies demonstrating that information technology (IT) is a critical enabler of public participation, not much is known on how county governments in Kenya are harnessing the power of technology for public participation. This research attempts to understand how IT is being used for public participation, and the current challenges associated with its application in the promotion of public participation in county governments in Kenya. This paper, presents the initial findings from one of the counties. The study used interviews with both junior and senior county officials. Additionally, county documents as well as information from county websites and social media platforms were used. The study findings have revealed that the use of IT was gaining prominence in county engagements with the public, more specifically, the use of social media. However, it would appear that civic participation through these platforms was minimal. Additionally, the county strategic documents reveal that e-participation is yet to be appreciated as a strategic factor in increasing and enriching public participation in county governance. Several challenges were also identified and these are presented in this paper. It was thus hoped that these findings would enable an increasing understanding of the prevailing local circumstances which inhibit e-participation within county governments. The findings have practical implications on how county governments in Kenya (and possibly other developing countries) may better position themselves to exploit technology for improved public participation.""",,"""J.

"""A Retrofit Design Science Methodology for Smart Metering Design in Developing Countries""","""Traditional meters present both the users and utilities providers with various challenges in developing countries. For instance utility providers must get access to their users' premises to be able to read these meters or check fraudulent connections. Users on the other hand have to wait for months or more before knowing their utility consumptions or join long queues to purchase credit for the post-payment and pre-payment meters respectively. This paper seeks to propose a design that retrofits traditional meters on site into smart meters by adding embedded units for communication and control. The study was conducted using a modified Design Science Methodology referred to as Retrofit Design Science Research Methodology (RDSRM). RDSRM argues that, the artifact in context (Smart Meter) has undergone evaluation and acceptance as critical for solving a defined problem and that there are enough literature to support its relevance. The traditional meters were studied and the proposed system was designed using General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) technology for communication, and Peripheral Interface Controller (PIC). Network based applications were developed to present both the consumers and the utilities with the ability to interact with the meters remotely. An attempt was made to address identified security issues of smart metering by using Message Digest 5 (MD5) Algorithm in the design. The system was evaluated based on smart metering requirements. The GPRS Retrofitted Smart Metering System (GRSMS) will reduce the cost of deploying smart meters.""",,"""J. Q. Azasoo; K. O.

"""Integration of smart wearable mobile devices and cloud computing in South African healthcare""","""The acceptance of cloud computing is increasing in a fast pace in distributed computing environment. The use of cloud environments for storage and data processing needs is on the rise. On the other hand, mobile devices have been seen as one of the most essential and affordable tool for data access. In South Africa, health care processes are mostly manually prepared. Collecting and analysing patient's information using the existing processes requires more effort. Generally these processes are prone to error and time consuming, and provide delay in information storage and accessibility. These conditions restrict monitoring and diagnostics capabilities thereof. The main aim of this study is to design a framework architecture that integrate smart wearable mobile devices and cloud computing in healthcare. The objective of this study are; investigating the existing devices; current status of healthcare research and cloud computing in South Africa; investigate the existing methods, models, architecture and frameworks that are used/proposed in health informatics to improve ubiquitous health care. We then will design the architecture that integrates smart wearable mobile device and cloud computing in public health care capable of aiding health-care professionals better manage patient bases by reducing or eliminating on-site consultations. This integration will be made possible by designing an integrated architecture that will enable patient's information to be stored in a centralised portal for remote access.

"""Online safety in South Africa - A cause for growing concern""","""We live in a technology-driven world, where information communication technology (ICT) is increasingly affordable, obtainable and accessible to all technology users, especially to school learners. Information communication technologies (ICTs) include a wide range of devices such as mobile phones, internet access, tablets and desktops. More and more school learners are exposed to ICT devices at school, at home and among friends. Besides being used for social purposes, these devices greatly assist school learners with education. However, a number of disadvantages in the form of risks and threats also prevail if learners do not protect themselves and their personal information. ICT or online risks are a cause for growing concern, and awareness and education are urgently required to ensure that school learners understand the risks and threats and how to avoid them. A number of countries have already started to focus on online safety, but South Africa is numbered among those that are falling behind.

"""Eye Gesture Based Communication for People with Motor Disabilities in Developing Nations""","""Current eye tracking systems for people with motor disabilities are expensive, restricted to only four eye movements, require constant re-calibration, assume literacy in English and offer no easy method to contact people during emergencies. Even though the above systems are flawed, they are crucial for the aforementioned individuals to communicate. Despite this, our surveys show that no such systems are in use for people in developing countries and there is a heavy dependence on simple yes or no answers. To overcome these obstacles we created E-ACE (Eye-based Alternative Communication Exchange) : A smartphone based system that allows the user to utilize nine eye movements rather than the traditional four. Our surveys show that many people with motor disabilities have difficulties in performing the conventional four eye movements. To counter this, E-ACE allows each user to create a personalized system which consists of their preferred four eye movements from a set of nine (four traditional, five new). To overcome the language barrier that many people face while using the current systems, E-ACE provides easy to understand pictures for a list of relevant English words and phrases which was curated from the doctors we surveyed. E-ACE also lets the user access an SOS Board that can call, message and alert the concerned people with just two eye movements. Thus, E-ACE offers a robust, portable and low-cost solution which solves the problems faced with current systems. Our Evaluations and User studies show that E-ACE has good user experience, is easily adopted by non-English speaking individuals, and is cost-effective, making it accessible to people in a developing nation.""",,"""S.

"""Insulator leakage current monitoring: Challenges for high voltage direct current transmission lines""","""Power transmission using HVDC transmission technology has existed for several years. As part of the design specification for such schemes, transmission line and substation insulator selection is crucial to ensure good operational performance. Leakage current may occur on insulators due to contamination, ageing of insulation materials and aggressive weather conditions, amongst others. If not mitigated, these currents can lead to line faults which occur as flashover of the insulator and the degradation of the insulator material. Monitoring leakage current on alternating current transmission lines may be accomplished using current transformer devices. However, this cannot be used in direct current transmission lines due to static magnetic fields. Toughened glass insulators are generally preferred for HVDC schemes, but composite insulators are proving to be cost-effective alternatives. However, because of its relatively new application in HVDC schemes, little has been published relating to operational data on typical leakage current magnitudes, waveforms and consequential effects thereof. ESKOM currently operates and maintains the South African sections of the Cahora Bassa HVDC scheme. At present, the utility does not have an in-situ, non-intrusive solution for monitoring the leakage currents on this scheme. This paper presents an overview of leakage current and the options available for measuring it. In-situ and non-intrusive sensors have the benefit of being used for real time monitoring as well as for live line work.""",,"""M. Roman; R. R. van Zyl; N. Parus; N.

"""Mobile Agent-Based approach for modeling the epidemics of communicable diseases""","""The increase in the use of mobile phones generates the formation of mobile social networks which can make use of various purposes including education, public health and controlling epidemics. Social networks consist of the basic building blocks called as the communities within which the social interactions are intensive, but between which they are very weak. Everyone could observe that the spread of infectious disease inside communities often has the ability to cross countries borders and spread rapidly. With the widespread of diseases causing major public health problem, we argue that human mobility patterns not only influence the spreading, but are also useful for preventing and creating awareness of the diseases. In this paper, we present new opportunities offered by the field of mobile social networks for understanding the spread of infectious diseases. For this purpose we propose two models namely MABM (Mobile Agent Based Model) and SDC (Spread Discovery Control) model to understand the spread of communicable diseases between different regions. The proposed SDC model is used to comprehend the spread of diseases by extracting the community structures and the analysis of mobility pattern of each agent (user) within the mobile network. Moreover, the understanding of spread details helps us to propose the control strategy to avoid the spread of the epidemic disease on the specific region. To realize our proposed models in a better way, we have modeled one such communicable disease usually spreading every year in West African region.""",,"""M. Saravanan; P. Karthikeyan; A. Arathi; M.

The CSaaS architecture model demonstrated that building such a system requires strong improvements in security which in turn insists upon a huge budget to accomplish its objectives. The demand and acquisition of an exorbitant budget poses a challenge to the sub-Saharan institutions due to scarcity of resources. Nevertheless, a solution was sought. The concept of a consortium was put forth to combat their deficiencies. Some examples of these African consortia are: the Partnership for Higher Education in Africa, involving eight (8) universities; The Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in Western and Central Africa comprising a hundred (100) institutions, the initiatives for the formation of National Research and Education Network (NRENs), are but a few of such organizations. All such assemblages demonstrated the capacity of sub-Saharan campuses to pool their material, capital and human resources together in a way that would exploit technologies like cloud computing. The CSaaS architecture model demonstrates how the underlying consortium campuses can be connected through the CSaaS system to the cloud. Such a system would be capable of managing Campus Management Systems which would include: student registration, examinations, student results, students learning materials, library information, research, scholarships, admission information, undergraduate and postgraduate programmes, student recreation, website, eLearning, internship, alumina, timetable, campus strategic plan, institution estate, hostels, dining and kitchen, campus clinic/hospital, staffing, administration, etc. With such a huge range of applications, the consortium members would only pay for the services on demand.

"""Development of an Interactive, Web-based Energy Usage Application for Residential Loads""","""The South African energy landscape is dominated by Eskom, the state-owned utility which generates 95% of the electricity used in South Africa. To meet the rising electricity demand, Eskom is now facing a supply and demand scenario where they can no longer afford the cost of consumer passivity and apathy and must leverage the benefits to be reaped from end-user energy efficiency initiatives. Although this paper focuses on the South African context, the pressures facing Eskom are not unique. Any electrical energy system should improve efficiency on both the supply and demand sides. Intervention is required to influence energy use. On the supply-side, interventions typically include the introduction of renewable sources to expand the energy mix and technological improvements to curb energy leaks and losses. On the demandside, interventions include both an improvement of the efficiency of end-use technologies as well as methods to influence the ways we use energy. A consumer's ability to make consumption decisions leads to more judicious electricity use, supporting peak demand management. Smart metering systems which provide real-time display of household energy use, is one such a tool to influence and empower a consumer to improve efficiency. This paper describes the development of a web-based evaluation tool for end-users to improve energy efficiency. It can be incorporated with a smart metering system or used as a stand-alone survey/auditing tool for gathering and evaluating consumption data. Available technologies were evaluated and due consideration given to current trends in improving user experiences on the web. Currently, Rich Internet Applications (RIAs), offer a more seamless data exchange process as well as a richer, more dynamic user interface. The Flex framework is the chosen RIA development platform, which is fully integrated with open-source PHP, as the server-side scripting language, and MySQL as the database.

The work was carried out in the monitoring of the tropical vegetation unit (MTV) of the European Commission space applications institute (SAI), Ispra, Italy, and within the R/D activity of the Tropical Ecosystem Environment Monitoring by satellites (TREES) project, this paper will give an overview of the CAMP project, the general setting is first established through the motivation and the rationale, as seen in the context of the TREES objectives, the main underlying concepts and the major innovative aspects of the CAMP machine, such as multiresolution pyramidal information structure and processing on demand, are highlighted, the focus is then shifted onto some radar science aspects and engineering issues of the processing chain, such as the statistical characterization of the baseline low-resolution products, and radiometry-related problems, preliminary thematic results based on visual interpretation are finally reported, at this stage of the project, it can already be concluded that the material provided by the ERS-1 Central Africa Mosaic constitutes a unique source of data on vegetation distribution at a continental scale, the most celebrated ""all-weather"" characteristic of active microwave sensing has taken its full meaning in the present case since a whole equatorial region has been covered on demand and in a minimum amount of time, and since a significant level of information on forest conditions has rapidly been extracted, this places the ERS-1 SAR approach firmly in a central position in the set of instruments to be further exploited for tropical forest monitoring.""",,"""G.

"""Design and implementing VoIP network in the national defence university of Sri Lanka""","""General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University (KDU) is a one of the largest defence universities in the South Asian region. Internal telecommunication facility at KDU is an analog system, “Iwatsu Adix-E”, designed by Lanka Telecom Company in October 2010. Due to the limited number of connection slots on the hub and the high cost of end-devices to set up the telecommunication network, only 220 selected high priority users are fortunate to use the intercom facility. Only a few features are provided by the existing analog system; such as voice communication, calls on-hold, and call transfer. Since the KDU is a large organization at multiple geographical locations, a large number of calls are exchanged through the private branch exchange (PBX) per day. The two main problems in the existing analog system are; number of extensions cannot be increased and rewiring new tall buildings are very difficult and time consuming. Qualitative research techniques; interviews and observations, were used to collect data. The technical staff in the control room were interviewed to collect information on the existing system. The proposed system, a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) would overcome the above mentioned problems in the existing system. This proposed system is a server-based-software-design, “AsteriskNow” software PBX Version 6.12.65–22. The TDM410p analog card is used to connect end-devices on a local area network (LAN). KDU has both a wired LAN and two (Wireless) Wi-Fi networks. KDU has its own Wi-Fi network provided by Lanka Education and Research Network (LERN) and the other by Dialog, the largest mobile operator in the Sri Lanka. Wi-Fi makes it is to connect the end devices to the server. But these wireless networks are not integrated and hence creating seamless connectivity issue. After implementing the VoIP system, there will be no additional cost (monetary) as service charges or monthly charges except a small maintenance cost and data charges. An authorized person or group of people can monitor all the conference and the data exchange through the system so the security of the system will be very high. No user can misuse the system in any manner. While the KDU is growing into multiple locations, the system can be easily expanded to provide the services with lower equipment cost, integration of voice and data applications, with lower bandwidth requirements. Proposed system with new features such as voicemail, call waiting, call conference and Instant Messaging (IM) will improve the existing telecommunication facilities at KDU.""",,"""L. D. S. B.

"""No Smurfs: Revealing Fraud Chains in Mobile Money Transfers""","""Mobile Money Transfer (MMT) services provided by mobile network operators enable funds transfers made on mobile devices of end-users, using digital equivalent of cash (electronic money) without any bank accounts involved. MMT simplifies banking relationships and facilitates financial inclusion, and, therefore, is rapidly expanding all around the world, especially in developing countries. MMT systems are subject to the same controls as those required for financial institutions, including the detection of Money Laundering (ML) - a source of concern for MMT service providers. In this paper we focus on an often practiced ML technique known as micro-structuring of funds or smurfing and introduce a new method for detection of fraud chains in MMT systems. Whereas classical detection methods are based on machine learning and data mining, this work builds on Predictive Security Analysis at Runtime (PSA@R), a model-based approach for event-driven process analysis. We provide an extension to PSA@R which allows us to identify fraudsters in an MMT service monitoring network behavior of its end-users. We evaluate our method on simulated transaction logs, containing approximately 460,000 transactions for 10,000 end-users, and compare it with classical fraud detection approaches. With 99.81% precision and 90.18% recall, we achieve better recognition performance in comparison with the state of the art.""",,"""M. Zhdanova; J. Repp; R. Rieke; C. Gaber; B.

"""A framework for managing and optimizing the adaptation process qualities""","""Multimedia technologies and advanced internet networks are vital to the economic development of both developed and developing countries. In the mobile multimedia domain, excellence is synonymous to the quality management of multimedia documents. Currently, these documents are accessible on a wide variety of devices, such as laptops, tablets and smartphones. The (hardware and software) heterogeneity of such devices and the diversity of user preferences require adaptation of multimedia documents. Current adaptation frameworks do not fully exploit the semantic benefits for describing the adaptation components and the quality of services. However, we have noticed that current adaptation frameworks do not handle any issue related to adaptation quality customization and optimization. This paper overcomes this limitation by proposing a generic framework for selecting a relevant set of adaptation services according to user preferences and allowing the automatic generation of a dynamic and a quality composition of heterogeneous adaptation components. Our proposal has the great advantage to offer to users a global flexible adaptation infrastructure for adaptation of multimedia document and customization of quality of service properties.""",,"""A.

"""Utilization of solar and biomass for rural electrification in Bangladesh""","""Electricity is a far-way dream for many families in developing countries rural area like Bangladesh. In Bangladesh nearly 75% of the population lives in rural areas and access to electricity in rural areas is only 22% Ensuring improved electricity supply is essential for socio-economic development and environmental sustainability. It has a direct influence on the life situation of the rural poor, affecting their productivity, health, education, and gender-related issues. The government of Bangladesh has a noble vision to provide electricity for all citizens by the year 2021. Suitable geographic location and as an agricultural country, Bangladesh is richly endowed with solar and biomass energy. So, solar and biomass energy together with national grid electricity is an appropriate option to meet the electricity requirements of people in rural areas. This paper examines Bangladesh rural area electricity demand and supply security by solar and biomass energy together with national grid electricity from 2010-2030 by using long range energy alternative planning system (LEAP) model. The results show that the total electricity demand of rural area in Bangladesh is about 27 TWh and is easily mitigated by solar and biomass energy together with national grid electricity. Solar and biomass electrification will provide direct and indirect benefits to the users of the system, with many implications of a permanent nature. Reduction of environment polluted kerosene usage is the main impact. A rural family can get bright light, watch TV, uses fan and power their mobile phones by using environment friendly renewable energy.

"""Coverage and Rate of Low Density ABS Assisted Vertical Heterogeneous Network""","""A vertical heterogeneous network (VHetNet) is an integration of aerial base stations (ABS) into the terrestrial cellular networks. ABSs are anticipated to enhance the communications performance of the network because they are mobile and are quick to deploy suitable for on demand coverage. They promise a low-cost solution for ubiquitous connectivity especially in developing countries where telecommunications infrastructure and the power grid are limited. Accurate and tractable frame-works are required to adequately quantify the communications performance of a VHetNet. In this paper we develop an analytical framework for determining the coverage probability and average rate of a heterogeneous network with aerial, macro and small base stations. We considered a scenario with low density of ABSs suited to financially constrained countries and those with security concerns over flying machines. The results show that there is an optimum ABS altitude and density that maximize the coverage probability at a specific signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) threshold. The average rate increases with density at low SIR threshold of -10 dB while at 0 dB the optimum density decreases with altitude.""",,"""S. Mugala; J. Serugunda; L. Zhang; D. Okello; J.

"""Evaluating soil contamination risks by using MicroLEIS DSS in El-Fayoum province, Egypt""","""The Agro-ecological Decision Support System, MicroLEIS DSS, was applied to investigate and predict soil degradation in the province of El-Fayoum, one of the western desert areas of the Arab Republic of Egypt, with an area of 149,300 ha approximately. The Pantanal land evaluation model as one constituents of this DSS, was used for evaluating contamination risks of phosphorus, nitrogen, heavy metals and pesticides. Pantanal is an expert system model based on three kinds of input data : I) monthly meteorological data contains average values of climate variables such as mean temperature, maximum and minimum rainfall, number of days of rain and humidity, for a consecutive period of 44 years, collected from the station of El- Fayoum; II) soil survey data collected from 46 soil profiles representative of the study area and stored in the MicroLEIS SDBm plus database; and III) agricultural information on soil use and management for major crops in the area, from scientific publications of the Ministry of Agriculture. The model application results are grouped in five vulnerability classes: V1-none, V2-low, V3-moderate, V4-high and V5-Extreme for each specific contaminant. Results obtained in El-Fayoum area show that 2.8%, 45.2% and 52% of total studied area were classified as V1, V3, and V4 vulnerable land due to phosphorous contamination. On the other hand 95.9 % and 4.1% of total studied area were classified as V3, and V4 vulnerable land due to nitrogen and heavy metals, and 6.1 %, 21.5 %, 68.8 % and 2.8% of total studied area were classified as V1, V2, V3, and V4 vulnerable land due to pesticides. Additionally, Typic Torripasamment soil has a high vulnerability classes for all the types of contaminants although it represents a residual area, of 2600 ha approximately. Finally hypothetical recommended scenarios were established for each soil types in order to formulate sustainable agriculture practices by reducing inputs use like water, fertilizers and pesticides, and so minimizing the risk of soil degradation due to contamination. In conclusion, MicroLEIS DSS appears to be a useful tool in this part of arid regions, such as north of Africa (Egypt), to formulate sustaining agro-ecological systems. Although information about land resources in this part of Africa is rather scarce, these innovative agro-ecological strategies can be applied and adapted in other agricultural provinces from the Arab Republic of Egypt in order to achieve a regional sustainable land management.""",,"""S.

"""Analysis and Control of Weak Grid Interfaced Autonomous Solar Water Pumping System for Industrial and Commercial Applications""","""The limited hours of availability and fluctuating behavior of solar insolation severely impact the reliability of solar photovoltaic (PV) integrated system. This article proposes a new topology of grid interactive solar water pumping (SWP) system to deal with the issue of frequent variation in insolation, related to solar power generation. Such intermittency affects the system performance and makes it unreliable for industrial and commercial applications. In contrary to the conventional voltage source converter, the proposed topology utilizes a reduced switch Vienna rectifier for utility grid integration. Although utility grid integration appears to be a viable solution, however, as most of the grid in underdeveloped and developing countries are generally weak, such integration faces the additional power quality challenges, like voltage sag, voltage swell, dc offset, harmonics distortion, etc. To deal with the problems associated with weak grid condition, a novel mix multiresonant generalized integrator (MMRGI) control structure is proposed in this article. Along with the selective harmonic elimination capability, the proposed MMRGI structure offers a high dc offset and higher-order harmonic rejection capability. The proposed control approach is also capable of effectively extracting the balanced positive sequence components from unbalanced distorted grid voltages, thereby, keeping the grid currents balanced. The proposed system uses a sensor-less vector control technique to drive the permanent magnet synchronous motor used for rotating the pump. A perturb and observe algorithm is used for optimum power harvesting from the solar PV array. A prototype of proposed system is developed and performance is investigated experimentally using a digital signal processor DS1202.""",,"""S. Murshid; B.

The work used an open-ended online qualitative survey and interviews as the data-collection methods. The collected evidence was analyzed using narrative analysis. The findings revealed that cybersecurity hygiene in SMBs varies from one business sector to the other. The absence of detailed rules, standards, procedures, and guidelines to promote good cybersecurity hygiene leads to poor cyber hygiene in SMBs. Results further showed the limitations of the use of current security measures and their practice.

The key focus of this paper is the consideration of the deployment of a post-modern commercial bartering mechanism (called Super Commerce). The model will exploit technological advances in systemic and non-systemic systems, which will result in the spontaneous liberation of money into the banking systems in countries across Africa and worldwide. From a macroeconomic perspective, the anticipated African economic renaissance was delayed due to a lack of e-business innovation, no collaboration amongst the financial services industry, no entrepreneurial participation and no information technology diffusion and nor innovation, mostly due to trade risk aversion. This paper provides a conceptual framework and methodology for the understanding of the development and the application of the proposed Super Commerce methodology within an African setting. Furthermore, the methodology offers a uniquely defined environment, with an implementation range outlined.

"""Evolutionary full-waveform inversion""","""We present a new approach to full-waveform inversion (FWI) that enables the assimilation of data sets that expand over time without the need to reinvert all data. This evolutionary inversion rests on a reinterpretation of stochastic Limited-memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (L-BFGS), which randomly exploits redundancies to achieve convergence without ever considering the data set as a whole. Specifically for seismological applications, we consider a dynamic mini-batch stochastic L-BFGS, where the size of mini-batches adapts to the number of sources needed to approximate the complete gradient. As an illustration we present an evolutionary FWI for upper-mantle structure beneath Africa. Starting from a 1-D model and data recorded until 1995, we sequentially add contemporary data into an ongoing inversion, showing how (i) new events can be added without compromising convergence, (ii) a consistent measure of misfit can be maintained and (iii) the model evolves over times as a function of data coverage.

The raspberry Pi is ARM1176JZFS application processor, System on chip (SoC) denoted as Broadcom BCM2835. It enhances performance, consumes less power, and reduces overall system cost and size. The raspberry Pi is been controlled by a modified version of Debian Linux optimized for ARM architecture. The image recognition is performed using open source OpenCV-2.4.9 in Linux platform using CMake, g++, makefile.

Solutions that are suitable to Africa's current state of ICT infrastructure are also necessary to better address the current academic need in Africa. A recent trend in education has seen a move from the traditional way in which students and people in general learn. No longer do people want to be limited to a given time and space for learning to occur. The way that people learn is constantly changing and as a result how, where and when people can learn needs to adapt to the new change. With the introduction of ICT into education, new avenues have been opened such as online learning, online tutors, interactive whiteboards and many others. Virtual classrooms have become more common with the introduction of Web 2.0 providing another platform on which students can engage academically. This paper presents and evaluates a whiteboard application over and IMS test-bed. The application will serve to provide an alternative platform for learning while fostering innovation in the ways that students learn with increased collaboration.""",,"""M. Nyarko; N.

"""Wind energy's promise, offshore""","""In November 2001, Cape Wind Associates, a Boston-based energy development firm, began the permitting application process with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to build the first offshore wind farm in the United States. The historical context and significance of the application, and of its continuing review process, is profound. On a global level looms ever-increasing evidence and recognition of the impacts of fossil fuel use and of resulting climate change. There is, correspondingly, increased urgency to develop renewable energy sources. And the world's demand for energy, especially in developing countries, continues to soar. Unlike the United States, Europe's response to the threat of global climate change has been to ratify the international Kyoto treaty on reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

"""Relevance of Grid Computing for India in the era of Cloud Computing""","""Grid Computing is often implemented by relying on the concept of sharing of available resources, in order to improve economies of scale and utilization. However, after the advent of Cloud Computing, the adoption of Grid Computing has been rather slow, and people wonder if it is still relevant, and whether Grid Computing truly matters. In a developing country like India where computer, smart phone and internet penetration is still low compared to richer nations, Grid Computing can make a huge difference in the adoption of scientific computing, by making niche resources available to the researchers. Grid Computing provides a framework to bridge the gap between what the researchers want and what they currently have. Grid aggregates available resources through efficient security mechanisms, meta-scheduling capabilities, and file transfer methodologies among others, and offers an unprecedented infrastructure for solving grand challenge problems. Grid Computing is here to stay, though it may not become as common as Cloud Computing, since it targets a comparatively niche set of users. It is also felt that the proponents of Grid Computing need to come up with new ideas and paradigms to improve the relevance of the grid in the changed scenario of computing.""",,"""V. S. Arackal; M.

"""Optimization of African LULC Database for Sustainable Development""","""Land use and land cover information in combination with other thematic datasets related to detailed reference spatial data in localities from an important dataset for different types of analyses in different domains. At the time being, when it comes to the strategy of the SDG, Green Deal, Destination Earth, and construction of Earth’s digital twins, there is no model and database that would effectively gather information about the Earth’s surface in sufficient detail and complex relations. The situation is much worse in Africa compared to Europe since there exist only scattered map layers from public sources across all Africa like Africover and CCI Land Cover 2016. Moreover, the other close option ‘OpenStreetMap’ with a continent-wide coverage collects data on a voluntary basis with minimal attributes. For this reason, it’s prudent to provide validation and harmonisation of this data. Therefore, there was a focus on developing and optimising a new solution based on the Open Land Use (OLU) 2.0 data model. The OLU 2.0 database combined various thematic data with the most detailed reference geometry available. Thematic datasets were focused primarily on the information of land use and land cover and additionally on other themes like soil, topographic characteristics, climatic parameters, data from classification of remote sensing data, vegetation indices of field blocks, etc. and in different time periods. In this way, OLU4Africa 2.0 defined a model which can have large potential in Africa for high-end applications such as food security modelling; environment, biodiversity, and ecosystem protection; planning purposes; forest and water protection.

"""A mobile learning application for delivering educational resources to mobile devices""","""Recording lectures have potential to serve as supplementary material to a conventional face-to-face lecture. One of the challenges of face-to-face lectures is the lack of persistency. In contexts of varied levels of student preparedness for higher education, such as South Africa, the lack of persistent of face-to-face lectures makes it difficult for students who struggle to understand lectures delivered in English which is a second or third language for most students. Recording of lectures provide flexibility on when and where it is played back whereby empowering students to self-pace their learning. This paper argues distribution of lecture resources as podcasts for listening to before and after class may enhance student engagement of lectures and foster interaction between student-student and student-lecturer, and student-content interaction. The use of automated approaches of recording face-to-face session, coupled with the affordances of distribution of audio via the Internet, has potential to enhance student learning and engagement with learning resources. The paper exploits the intersection between mobile devices for playback of audio media and Opencast for automated recording of face-to-face sessions and proposes a mobile framework to expose opencast artifacts to mobile devices.""",,"""O.

"""ICT supported extension services in conservation agriculture information access for small holder farmers in Laikipia County, Kenya""","""This paper examines how Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) are used in the Conservation Agriculture (CA) knowledge pathways. It discusses the parallel knowledge pathways smallholder farmers' use to access conservation agriculture information. The objective of this study is to develop an effective dissemination model that exploits the use of ICTs in existing pathways in order to improve Conservation Agriculture knowledge flows. Design, Methodology and Approach: A total of one hundred and twenty-five respondents were interviewed, with a purposively selected sample of 110 CA farmers interviewed using semi-structured questionnaires. Using the snowball method, 15 key informant interviews were conducted with Policy makers and ICT service providers. 69% of the respondents were female and 51% male. The focus of the study was on the different ICTs used in the CA knowledge pathways, the dissemination pathways, institutional and socio-economic factors. Data was analyzed manually and using SSPS ver. 21. Preliminary findings indicate that a variety of knowledge pathways exist through which farmers can access CA knowledge. Four different kinds of ICT led models were identified, Government ICT led models, Government-NGO led models, Government-NGO-Private Sector ICT led model and NGO ICT led models. However the study notes a lack of harmonization and weak linkages between institutions in the utilization of the existing ICT models, utilization of the ICTs access and ownership at the household level and harmonization of the CA messages. Furthermore, even though there was 100% mobile phones ownership, 94% radio, 64% television, 10% Laptop and 9% Computer (desktop) access and ownership among the respondents, farmers and a large number of the extension staff lacked the skills to fully exploit the use of these tools to access CA knowledge. Implication: New emerging and existing communication technologies have a very high potential to improve agricultural knowledge flows if taken advantage of by the ""change agents"" in the diffusion process of new innovations. New online technologies known as Web 2.0 and `social media' are slowly emerging as platforms for collaboration, sharing of product and market information. Open chain models of village information centres also provide numerous economic opportunities, and do also network communities while providing public/private services. The opportunity of using real time communication tools has been greatly embraced especially by the youthful farmers and the advantage of these new emerging tools is their unique attributes, similar to the traditional oral cultures of communication seen in the African social systems where one can see, hold a discussion, get immediate feedback and use the written media to convey messages. The high percentage of ownership and accessibility of ICTs among the survey population also offers the potential to fully exploit ICTs in the improvement of the CA knowledge pathways and agricultural information provision.""",,"""A.

"""Islanding power systems to minimize impact of system disturbances in Southern African Power Pool""","""When power utilities physically connect their transmission equipment they form an interconnection. In an interconnection power utilities trade electricity. In so doing they optimize energy resources for environmental sustainability, regional integration and socio-economic growth. In southern Africa, power systems of nine countries are interconnected. Most of these power systems were originally designed to operate as islands, supplying loads within national boundaries. Most interconnectors were commissioned after 1995 when the Southern African Power Pool (SAPP) was officially formed. The larger the interconnected system grew the more complex it became. Utilities started experiencing disturbances emanating from outside their borders. Due to weak interconnections, most disturbances triggered power oscillations. Often, power oscillations led to cascading equipment failures that threatened the reliability of power supply and could easily culminate into blackouts. Towards the end of 2015, the SAPP commissioned special protection schemes at two key interconnection points. The schemes were designed to intentionally split the interconnection in order to minimize the impact of system disturbances. This paper reviews the application of special protection schemes; gives examples of typical system disturbances in SAPP; and discusses lessons learnt. The paper observes that it is important to endeavor to eliminate the initiating events of system disturbances. However, due to some unforeseen events such as weak connections, hidden failures in protection systems or human error, system disturbances may still occur. In this case, the paper concludes that implementing special protection schemes is one of the cost-effective means of achieving safety and reliability of power supply. To improve their effectiveness, 1) they have to be coordinated among power utilities in an interconnection; 2) power system operators have to be adequately trained; and 3) new technologies such as the use of phasor monitoring units have to be adopted.""",,"""S.

Nautical charts on African coasts are old and had often been established in the 1950s. Local geodetic reference systems used are not well known, so maps are not in accordance with GPS navigation. In French Guiana, coastal evolution is so important that nautical charts are obsolete. Sedimentation and erosion of mangrovia vegetation can reach one kilometre per year. We study the contribution of RADAR SAR imagery for nautical chart updates. Our interests are coastline, interidal zone delimitation, harbour structures and bathymetry (<20 metres). We present solutions for different problems. First, for cartographic applications, we reference geographically our ERS images in a global geodetic reference system without ground points, we use precise orbitographic products, differences between geoid and global ellipsoid and ERS annotation files: precision estimation of this step was made by GPS measurements and also comparison between images acquired in ascending and descending mode. Second, ground interpretations permit first in Mauritania and French Guiana to follow coastal evolution and particularly coastline erosion and flood risk zones, and last in Cameroon to understand high and low vegetation distribution in mangrovia and in Wouri estuary, to follow sand banks which obstruct the Douala city channel.

The presence of this pest costs the government to use drones and other special forces to strive for it, but pest will remain a problem if there is no regular, automatic way to detect the pest and strive for it at the early days of attacking the crop. This paper introduces a design of a prototype of an automated system that will be able to detect the presence of a fall armyworm in the field. The system will use the new technology of Internet of Things (IoT) where sensors are used to identify the pest location. Once the presence of the pest is detected in the farm, the system will be able to give the information of the affected crop and notify the farmer through his/her mobile phone who will immediately react accordingly. Through the authorization from the farmer, the system will be able to pump pesticides to kill both larvae and eggs of fall armyworm on the affected crop. This automated system will save the farmer's time, as it will monitor the crops while the farmer is occupied with other activities. Lastly the system will help to increase the production of maize in Rwanda since the crop will be safe from the pest.""",,"""D. Hanyurwimfura; E. Nizeyimana; F. Ndikumana; D. Mukanyiligira; A.

"""5G-Ready Multi-Failure Resilient and Cost-Effective Transport Networks""","""Data explosion and higher service level agreements (SLA) are common terminologies in modern communication networks. Recent advancements toward 5G networks add to the complexity where billions of devices, both static and mobile, are connected generating trillions of megabits of data flooding the network and where service providers scuffle daily to deliver key performance indicators: Lower latency, longer battery life, higher data rates, ultra-high reliability, and more connected devices. The optical-fiber world simultaneously witnesses a denser, fiber-rich network infrastructure which is critically challenged in fast economically developing countries by heavy construction of roads and other infrastructures that inflict repeated and unpredictable cuts to the extent that traffic is simultaneously interrupted in up to 10% of the optical links. Thus, network resiliency to fiber failures is already and will continue to be a top priority for operators. Depending on the SLA, operators choose from various resiliency options, e.g., at single network layers or across multiple ones, with dedicated protection or shared restoration, depending on decisive factors like network availability and total cost of ownership (TCO). With traditional network architectures, high resiliency comes with significantly increased TCO involving optical transport network (OTN) switches, L1 protection switching, and L1 restoration. This translates into high CAPEX and excessive space and power consumption, hampering the desirable seamless scalability with the continuously increasing demand for more capacity. This paper explores an alternative hyperscale network architecture, which is adaptable and resilient to multiple fiber failures, thus delivering committed service levels to the end users and which, at the same time, significantly reduces network cost compared to a traditional all OTN-switched network. The hyperscale architecture exploits low footprint carrier grade, data center interconnect type high-density transponders and cost-effective optical protection switching and restoration via software defined networking control. The paper also describes a routing and grooming algorithm to dimension a shared resource pool for optical restoration and a statistical simulation method for time effective execution, simulating failures over a carefully selected sub-set of failure scenarios to guarantee a high degree of network availability. Via network simulation, the paper demonstrates that multiple failure resiliency and cost effectiveness do not necessarily represent a contradiction in transport networks as long as an appropriate network architecture is chosen and that efficient network planning and optimization are applied.""",,"""B.

"""A predictive model for optimizing acceptance and use of mHealth interventions in low-resource settings: A case of Mamacare prototype""","""The health status of women and children is considered as a reflection of the present society and a predictor of the future generations. Unfortunately, numerous challenges emanating from poverty, inadequate resources, illiteracy and cultural barriers contribute to poor health and high mortality rate in low-resource settings. To address these challenges, there are numerous mHealth interventions seeking to exploit opportunities provided by over 90% mobile penetration in developing countries. However, research shows that most of the interventions have failed to justify their value proposition to motivate integration into the conventional healthcare systems. This poor up-take requires a holistic approach in order to align mHealth solutions to consumer needs in the intended context of use. In this paper, we present a conceptual model named TIPFit that forms the basis for predicting acceptance and use of mHealth intervention at the design stage. To measure the predictive power of the model, we conducted repeated measures experiment using a cohort of 79 randomly selected subjects. During design of mHealth intervention named Mamacare, we operationalized TIPFit model into blueprints used for prototyping Mamacare; and indicators for data collection during the experiment. To analyze the pre-intervention dataset, we used Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) that predicted 66.9% acceptance and 60.7% intended use. To evaluate the predictive power of the model, the cohort was recruited into Mamacare intervention that involved sending targeted SMS alerts as well as receiving real-time data on vital signs such as blood pressure. Results from datasets obtained after exposing the subjects to the intervention demonstrated 60.2% acceptance and 47.6% actual use. Although there was significant difference between our prediction and actual outcome, the study demonstrates that use of TIPFit model at the design stage is crucial to predicting fit and utilization of mHealth solutions in low-resource settings. Furthermore, the study shows that the proposed model can be tailored into a tool for evaluating intervention's progress towards attainment of desired health outcome.""",,"""S.

"""Choquet Integral and Coalition Game-Based Ensemble of Deep Learning Models for COVID-19 Screening From Chest X-Ray Images""","""Under the present circumstances, when we are still under the threat of different strains of coronavirus, and since the most widely used method for COVID-19 detection, RT-PCR is a tedious and time-consuming manual procedure with poor precision, the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) is inevitable. Though, some vaccines have now been authorized worldwide, it will take huge time to reach everyone, especially in developing countries. In this work, we have analyzed Chest X-ray (CXR) images for the detection of the coronavirus. The primary agenda of this proposed research study is to leverage the classification performance of the deep learning models using ensemble learning. Many papers have proposed different ensemble learning techniques in this field, some methods using aggregation functions like Weighted Arithmetic Mean (WAM) among others. However, none of these methods take into consideration the decisions that subsets of the classifiers take. In this paper, we have applied Choquet integral for ensemble and propose a novel method for the evaluation of fuzzy measures using coalition game theory, information theory, and Lambda fuzzy approximation. Three different sets of fuzzy measures are calculated using three different weighting schemes along with information theory and coalition game theory. Using these three sets of fuzzy measures, three Choquet integrals are calculated and their decisions are finally combined. Besides, we have created a database by combining several image repositories developed recently. Impressive results on the newly developed dataset and the challenging COVIDx dataset support the efficacy and robustness of the proposed method.

"""Bridging the gap between energy research and energy development impact""","""Summary form only given. Increasing access to clean, affordable energy services is a critical factor for progress on the Millennium Development Goals and for reducing poverty and hardship among a sizeable portion of the global community. Addressing this energy and development challenge requires not only technological advances to bring down cost and scale, but also innovative deployment and market creation strategies that may be specific to the social, economic and geographic context. More platforms where technology development is undertaken with knowledge and explicit consideration of the deployment context (e.g. weak physical infrastructure and limited markets) are desperately needed. Universities play a key role as a source for technological innovation, but the connection between the research lab and the unique requirements for energy technologies and systems in a development context is often missing. At the Masdar Institute, a newly established, research-driven university in Abu Dhabi, the Laboratory for Energy and Poverty Solutions (LEAPS) has recently been created to attempt to bridge the gap between energy research and potential applications for poor communities in the developing world. LEAPS is anchored by a semester-long graduate course focusing on systems-level solutions for meeting energy and water needs with local, renewable resources. As part of the course, students visit a case study site where they design and undertake a project with local community partners. An important outcome from the course is for students to realize how their energy-related research can be applied in a development context. One ongoing case study is investigating various aspects of operating a small microhydro powered microgrid for a remote community in East Malaysia, and a future case study is under development for electricity and water provision in Somaliland. This paper first presents a brief background on the Masdar Institute and its unique focus on research into advanced energy and sustainability. The motivation and model behind LEAPS is then described with a focus on experiences and lessons learned from integrating case study projects with a developing community into a course on renewable energy technologies.

"""Migrating Cretaceous–Eocene Magmatismin the Serra do Mar Alkaline Province,SE Brazil: Melts from the Deflected Trindade Mantle Plume?""","""The Serra do Mar province extends for ∼500 km as plutonic complexes, some with volcanic remnants, and dyke swarms along coastal SE Brazil. The igneous rocks are emplaced into metamorphics of the Brasiliano (Pan-African) Ribeira mobile belt, which abuts the southern margin of the Archaean São Francisco craton. Syenites and phonolites dominate most complexes but mafic–ultramafic dykes (MgO <16.4%) are also widespread, together with sparse mafic lavas. The mafic rocks are alkali basalts, basanites and melanephelinites, with rare leucitites and minettes (s.l.). Major and trace elements of all but a few of the strongly potassic rock types are indistinguishable from ocean-island basaltic (OIB, s.l.) magmatism. Isotopically (Sr–Nd), the Serra do Mar suite overlaps the field for OIB (εNd up to +2.7) and aseismic ridges, especially Walvis. In general, the most potassic compositions have the lowest εNd values (−1.4 to −3.3). We consider the most plausible source for Serra do Mar mafic magmas to be predominantly sub-lithospheric convecting mantle, with sporadic input from lithospheric metasomites. Additionally, the two most Mg-rich dykes have high 87Sr/86Sri (>0.707), despite εNd in the same range as nearby mafic dykes. We attribute this to upper-crust contamination during turbulent emplacement of very hot, low-viscosity magma batches. New K/Ar dates, together with a detailed assessment of published ages, show that the initiation of Serra do Mar magmatism migrated progressively ∼500 km ESE, from Poços de Caldas to Cabo Frio, between ∼80 and 55 Ma. It is inferred that the Trindade mantle plume impacted at ∼85 Ma beneath interior SE Brazil where the lithosphere was too thick (>150 km), except very locally, to permit dry decompression melting and basaltic (s.l.) magma genesis. Instead, strongly alkalic, potassic, lithosphere-source magmatism (including diamondiferous kimberlites) broke out penecontemporaneously over a region of ∼600 km radius. Between ∼85 and 80 Ma it is suggested that the starting-plume head expanded rapidly beneath the thick continental lithospheric lid. This caused regional kilometre-scale uplift and erosion (evidenced by published apatite fission-track data) for 1200 km to the south, together with strongly alkaline magmatism at Lages, southern Brazil, a site of localized rifting. After ∼80 Ma, as the plume tail moved ESE beneath the Archaean São Francisco craton, its magmatic signal at the surface was ‘switched off’ by the thick (200–250 km) cratonic lithosphere. Nevertheless, hot plume-tail mantle ‘leaked’ progressively southward, until it encountered strongly thinned lithosphere beneath SE coastal Brazil, along the passive margin of the South American plate, where decompression melting generated the predominant OIB-like component of the Serra do Mar magmatism. After 55 Ma this magmatism transferred NE from Cabo Frio to the Abrolhos Platform (52 Ma), the landward terminus of the seamount chain leading to the islands of Trindade and Martin Vaz in the South Atlantic.""",,"""R.

"""Managing diseases thru' Asclepios: An agile information exploitation framework""","""This paper describes the development of an open-source information system, called Asclepios, which manages a plethora of information on communicable diseases in an agile manner. Asclepios exploits information from multiple databases from both open sources (Third Party) and Second party sources. A variety of tools are available in Asclepios to perform extensive processing of numeric and texts (along with some image and video processing) so that trend information can be gleaned on various communicable diseases. The Asclepios architecture draws together a confluence of technologies and industrial standards such as: cloud computing, metadata, ontology generation and management, artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, decision support system, data mining and systems engineering. Because of the use of Component Based Software Engineering (CBSE) methodology for its design, the architecture is scalable, its components replaceable dynamically and configured for the requirements of a given application. The underlying architecture of Asclepios is therefore horizontal, but it has an ability to support several verticals as epidemiology, pharmacology and other fields easily. The application of Asclepios is wide ranging - from military to Government through to medical and tourism and pharmaceuticals.

"""An automated insar processing system: Potentials and challenges""","""Summary form only given. A new era of space-based surveillance for global changes has begun with newly launched Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) missions Sentinel-1A and ALOS-2 and the upcoming RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RMC) and NASAISRO (NISAR). Heavy loads of SAR data are expected to be acquired regularly in the near future. This no doubt, is good news for a wide range of research applications. However, it also remains challenging to effectively handle such large amounts of SAR data. Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) is a technique for measuring local topography and ground deformation by using two or more SAR images. Due to its unprecedented spatial and temporal resolutions, and subcentimeter to submillimeter accuracy, the InSAR technique has played an important role in solving a series of global issues such as geohazards (i.e. earthquakes, volcano eruptions), climate change (i.e. permafrost thawing) and land subsidence (due to mining and urban development). The new satellites can further strengthen potentials of InSAR to help better understand global changes. Early automated InSAR systems have been developed to provide rapid services in some specific applications (i.e. volcano monitoring in Africa). At the Canada Centre for Mapping and Earth Observation, Natural Resources Canada, a High Performance Computing (HPC) system is being designed for on-demand interferometric processing of SAR data from RADARSAT-2, RCM (to be launched in 2018) and other satellites. With such an automated processing system, even unexperienced users can generate their own InSAR products from various SAR datasets. Beneficiary clients include various research centers of the Natural Resources Canada and other government departments and agencies. For comparability with pre-existent infrastructure, the designed system will consist of two components: Graphical User Interface (GUI) unit connected to database and data archive, and HPC Linux cluster. To access GUI, user will require authorization and various authorization levels will be developed for limiting access to particular data sets. This unit will allow user to select data that needs to be processed, design processing chain and submit processing request to HPC. The HPC will read processing request and initiate processing sequence. For this various primary and supplementary data will first be collected by HPC from the remote servers. It is expected that the amount of data for a single processing request may exceed 100 GB and multiple requests will be handled simultaneously. User will be notified of processing completion and provided with the information on how to retrieve processing results. Multiple security mechanisms will be implemented in order to protect this system from unauthorized access.

But, now a days it is been exploited heavily by dumping of human waste, industrial and chemical waste in to the water bodies which is the resultant of water being contaminated with toxic chemicals. Water scarcity and water contamination has been one of the major issues faced by the society around the world. In many developing countries like India, the main focus is given to industrialization and urbanization. But this has caused an increased water usage and water contamination. This paper deals with the monitoring of water quality by mainly considering the physical and chemical properties of water.

The main components of WSN include microcontroller for processing the system, communication system for inter and intra node communication and several sensors. The power for the sensor nodes are obtained from the solar panels connected to the sensor nodes. Though, in earlier times, there were water quality monitoring systems, they were power hungry and not real time. Apart from acting as a single system, if this system integrates with other innovative solutions like Smart Home or Smart Building, the application of this system would increase leading to an increased demand for it.

"""Short-Term Load Forecasting Enhanced With Statistical Data-Filtering Method""","""Short-term load forecasting (STLF) plays an increasingly important role in power-flow dispatch, design and planning of power systems. To enhance the accuracy of STLF, in recent years, time-series approaches and other intelligent methods are strongly exploited in load forecasting models of distribution networks. In developing countries, the load demand can be suddenly changed by power consumption from different customers, e.g. industrial customers, residential customers, so the load dataset is often unstable. As a result, reliability assessment of the load dataset is very necessary for the pre-processing of data-filtering methods. This paper introduces a novel data-filtering method that considers the reliability of dataset by analyzing a wide range of pre-defined confidence levels. This proposed data-filtering method is also compared to other existing data-filtering methods (e.g. Kalman filter, Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), Wavelet transform and Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA)). Case studies of short-term load forecasting using the real data from the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system of a typical distribution network in Vietnam are conducted with an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model and a conventional (ARIMA) statistical model in order to validate the novel statistical data-filtering method proposed. The achieved results demonstrate which according to the most confidence level of the load dataset, the STLF using ANN and ARIMA models with the proposed statistical data-filtering method can outperform that with the existing data-filtering methods. For example, regarding the typical distribution network in Vietnam, the highest confidence level of the load dataset is about 95% when doing the STLF.""",,"""M. T. Cao; T. T. Pham; T. C. Kuo; D. M.

"""SUPPLYDECK – A Blockchain-Based Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Management""","""With the rising competition among pharmaceutical companies, the current drug supply chain market has become more competitive with high-quality product segments. The rapid growth of internet pharmacies has made it more difficult to standardize drug safety throughout in complex distributed supply chain networks. There is a high chance of introducing counterfeit drugs which are almost the same as the original pharmaceuticals. Due to the lack of transparency the possibility of tampering with drugs in the current manual and web-based pharmaceutical systems is extremely high. Throughout the past recent years, these counterfeit drugs were recognized as the one of major worldwide problems. This situation is worse in developing countries. The unavailability of verifying the legitimacy of drug suppliers and poor mechanisms to trace the drugs were identified as critical points that need to be resolved. SUPPLYDECK comes as a solution for the critical scenario mentioned. This solution addresses the above problems using blockchain technology, as a distributed digital ledger that ensures transparency, traceability, and security. This can show promise for solving some global supply chain management problems using smart contracts and user authentication along with IoT technology and machine learning concepts that are critically examined with this potential application.""",,"""A.

"""A Decision-Making Model With Intuitionistic Fuzzy Information for Selection of Enterprise Resource Planning Systems""","""Involvement of small and medium-scale enterprises is important for developing countries like India. Henceforth, enhancing their competency with the adoption of a suitable enterprise resource planning system (ERPS) is a vital way to enhance their competitiveness. The choice of an appropriate ERPS can be considered as a complex multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) problem where several alternatives (ERPS packages) are assessed based on certain types of characteristics, namely domain knowledge of the supplier, system reliability, service and support, functionality, compatibility, information security, cross-module integration, etc. One critical issue associated with the evaluation of ERPSs is the handling of uncertain information. In this article, we first develop a new methodology to resolve the issue of MCDM problems. In this methodology, the weights of decision experts are systematically calculated with the extended variance approach on intuitionistic fuzzy sets. For calculating the criteria weights, an optimization model based on cross-entropy is proposed, and for the aggregation of the criteria values, a new model called intuitionistic fuzzy improved measurement alternatives and ranking based on the compromise solution is developed, which allows both the vector and linear normalizations and having the advantages of comprising two kinds of aggregation models. Next, an ERPS cloud vendor assessment problem is deliberated with three alternatives (A1: Systems, Applications, and Products (SAP), A2: Oracle Corporation, A3: Microsoft Corporation) and 16 criteria to interpret the reasonableness of the introduced framework. According to the outcomes, SAP is the most suitable alternative. Next, a sensitivity analysis is exhibited with diverse parameter values to inspect the permanence of the presented approach. The advantage of the presented approach is discussed with the comparative investigation.""",,"""P. P. Deb; D. Bhattacharya; I. Chatterjee; A. Saha; A. R. Mishra; S. H.

"""Early Detection of Casava Plant Leaf Diseases using EfficientNet-B0""","""Image recognition plays a major role in everyday life applications like medical image analysis, gaming, surveillance and security, industrial automation, and more recently it has gained massive backing in the agricultural industry to identify plant diseases in crops. Plant diseases are a huge problem in agriculture and incorporating machine learning algorithms for their early detection will help better yields and save the farmers from loses. This paper entails the use of such machine learning algorithms to detect leaf diseases in the cassava plant. Cassava is one of the largest sources of carbohydrates for the continent of Africa. It is also very vulnerable to several plant diseases; this in turn threatens the food security of the continent. The present study is based on four of such diseases that affect the cassava yield namely, Cassava Bacterial Blight (CBB), Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD), Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD), and Cassava Green Mottle (CGM). In this research work, EfficientNet-B0 is proposed for the early detection of these diseases. The EfficientNet-B0 models outperform existing CNNs in terms of accuracy and efficiency while reducing parameter size and FLOPS by an order of magnitude. It is easier to detect disease at an early stage without the assistance of professionals, saving farmers both time and money. And our proposed model gave an accuracy of 92.6%.""",,"""V. Y; N.

Vero cells were detached from the substrate with 8 μm aperture micropipette cantilever, and their FD-curves were investigated besides the actual cell size. The results on 19 individual cells indicate that cell size and adhesion force may deviate; however, highly adhered cells require a greater distance to detach them compared to weakly adhered cells. Adhesion force and energy of the cell normalized by their cell area also show rising linear tendencies with the detachment distance.

"""Aerosol retrieval from 1064 and 532/1064 nm LITE data""","""The Lidar In-space Technology Experiment (LITE) Shuttle mission demonstrated that spaceborne lidar offers an effective means for detecting the spatial features of significant regional aerosol concentrations resulting, for example, from Saharan dust, African and South American biomass burning, and anthropogenic sources. Quantitative retrievals of aerosol backscatter and extinction profiles have been obtained from the LITE data at 532 nm via calibration to upper atmosphere molecular backscatter and constraints supplied by modeling or auxiliary transmittance measurements. However, the weaker molecular backscatter level coupled with greater detector noise for the 1064-nm channel has prevented successful application of this same calibration and retrieval approach to the 1064-nm LITE data. The authors have now managed to achieve reasonable 1064-nm aerosol retrievals using a combination of methods including normalizing to lower altitudes, using calibrations based on surface returns, added signal conditioning, applying different solution forms of the lidar equation, and combining 532/1064-nm data subject to constraints set by modeling and two wavelength auxiliary transmittance data.

"""Developing a Java based RFID application to automate student attendance monitoring""","""Research has proved that there is a high correlation between high class attendance and academic performance. Learning is a progressive activity which builds upon those of the previous day(s). Reading material and working independently do not compensate for the loss of insight gained by being physically present in classroom environment. As a result attendance monitoring should be an integral part of any institution especially a tertiary institution. The major challenge that a facilitator has in monitoring attendance is the sheer paper work and subsequent administrative work that follows the process if it is done manually. Many techniques have been developed to automate attendance monitoring including the use of biometrics. These techniques have their own strengths and weaknesses.

"""Case study of using multidisciplinary techniques to redesign electric motors""","""Re-designing an electric motor by using higher quantities and/or quality of active materials (reducing as a consequence the motor losses) is a basic method used in product development activities.

Millions of swimming pool motors (SPM) are running without electricity consumption being scrutinized (EC's efficiency grading system bands starts from 1.1 kW). Swimming pool unit is attracting the owner attention only when it fails. In about 65...75% of failures, motor replacement criterion is preferred, decision being based on initial investment. However, besides increased values of efficiency, the market trend is more orientated towards longer lifetime trouble free expectation at competitive prices.

"""Instrument transformers influence on harmonic measurements for grid code compliance""","""With an increased penetration of renewable energy sources in South Africa, especially photovoltaic (PV) and wind farm generating plants, power quality is becoming more important for utilities. With that also the accuracy of the measurements involved. For independent power producers (IPPs), these measurements are used to prove compliance to the national grid codes. Inaccurate results could prove devastating for an IPP and the predicted revenue to be generated to recover capital expenditure. One of the many electro-magnetic compatibility factors to be considered in this process of proving compliance, is the harmonic emissions of these plants. Instrument transformers form a key part of the harmonic measuring circuit. It is therefore important to ensure that the frequency response of these instrument transformers and the errors involved are quantified, in order to reduce the uncertainty in measurements. This paper considers literature of studies conducted on both current transformers and voltage transformers in this field. These studies show that significant errors, both in amplitude and phase angle, are involved when using instrument transformers for harmonic measurements. However, no mention is made on how the measuring errors can be taken into account during the characterization of these transformers. This paper focused on the aspects to be considered when quantifying these errors in measurements. A conclusion is drawn as to the important aspects to consider when developing a method to characterize and compensate for measuring uncertainties when instrument transformers are used for harmonic measurements, especially in renewable energy plant applications.""",,"""R.

"""Performance assessment on expanding SBAS service areas of GAGAN and MSAS to Singapore region""","""In past decade, the GPS plays an important role in many navigation applications. In some cases, the GPS is the only device providing navigation service. For safety-of-life user, GPS alone cannot provide the stringent performance in accuracy, integrity and availability. As a result, several SBAS (Satellite Based Augmentation System) systems have been developed to provide corrections and assistances to GPS users. The notably SBAS systems are U.S. WAAS (Wide Area Augmentation System), Europe EGNOS (European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service) and Japanese MSAS (Multi-functional Satellite Augmentation System), In addition, India and Russia have engaged in the deployment and development of SBAS system, named GAGAN (GPS Aided Geo Augmented Navigation) and SDCM (System of Differential Correction and Monitoring). Also, other regions in the world currently proceed feasibility studies on SBAS. For instance, SACCSA (The Augmentation Solution for the Caribbean, Central America and South America) project in Latin-America, ASAS (African Satellite Augmentation System) in Africa and Malaysian SBAS. SBAS broadcast the correction for ionosphere delay and satellite clock. By using these corrections, the user position accuracy can improve to several meters or better. In Singapore, Changi airport is one of busiest airport in the world, and it handled more than fifty million passengers in 2012. Additionally, Singapore is located in the equatorial region so that the ionosphere activities are dramatic. Currently, there is no SBAS service in the Singapore region. The objective of this paper is to propose a fusion scheme to exploit the correction and integrity monitoring messages from nearby two SBAS systems, GAGAN and MSAS and then provide a reliable correction for GPS users. Singapore is not located in the service volume of either GAGAN or MSAS. Because of the lack of SBAS monitoring stations, the navigation quality in Singapore region cannot be assured through either GAGAN or MSAS. The messages from both SBAS systems can be still received. Therefore, it is desired to investigate how messages from GAGAN and MSAS can be utilized to enhance the performance for GPS user. Then, its goal is to ensure a smooth transition and assured navigation performance in this region. In the paper, both GAGAN and MSAS messages are firstly received and analyzed for the assessment of the signal quality. And then, a comparison with the requirements at different phases of flight is made. A synergistic integration of the messages from by GAGAN and MSAS in Singapore is developed to pave a way for the future regional augmentation system implementation. An extrapolation scheme is proposed to expand the coverage of ionospheric delay correction messages from GAGAN and MSAS. All proposed fusion and extrapolation schemes are assessed by using real data to evaluate performance. The result shows that our approach has reliable performance compared to a surveying-grade receiver.""",,"""Y. -F. Tsai; K. -S.

"""Improving Tuberculosis Diagnostics Using Deep Learning and Mobile Health Technologies among Resource-Poor and Marginalized Communities""","""Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic infectious disease worldwide and remains a major cause of death globally. Of the estimated 9 million people who developed TB in 2013, over 80% were in South-East Asia, Western Pacific, and African. The majority of the infected populations was from resource-poor and marginalized communities with weak healthcare infrastructure. Reducing TB diagnosis delay is critical in mitigating disease transmission and minimizing the reproductive rate of the tuberculosis epidemic. The combination of machine learning and mobile computing techniques offers a unique opportunity to accelerate the TB diagnosis among these communities. The ultimate goal of our research is to reduce patient wait times for being diagnosed with this infectious disease by developing new machine learning and mobile health techniques to the TB diagnosis problem. In this paper, we first introduce major technique barriers and proposed system architecture. Then we report two major progresses we recently made. The first activity aims to develop large-scale, real-world and well-annotated X-ray image database dedicated for automated TB screening. The second research activity focus on developing effective and efficient computational models (in particularly, deep convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based models) to classify the image into different category of TB manifestations. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach. Our future work includes: (1) to further improve the performance of the algorithms, and (2) to deploy our system in the city of Carabayllo in Perú, a densely occupied urban community and high-burden TB.""",,"""Y.

"""Deep Learning Approach for Intelligent Financial Fraud Detection System""","""Law enforcement authorities continually confront new and vexatious frauds involving computer virus attacks or credit card frauds committed against financial institutions and banking card companies. Such phenomenon used to commit online banking fraudulent transactions are occurring continuously and lead to a loss of gargantuan amount of money. Information security specialists and associations usually refer to the process of selecting practitioners as safeguards of fraud assessment, fraud analysis, or fraud detection. Designating such safeguards based on fraud calculations can be a exasperating and high-price process over the past few decades. This paper aims to understand how deep learning (DL) models can be benevolent in detecting fraudulent transactions with high accuracy. Dataset is extracted from one month of genuine financial logs of a mobile money service company in Africa, containing about more than six million transactions. The most satisfactory machine learning techniques as ensemble of decision tree (EDT), and deep learning techniques as stacked auto-encoders (SAE) and Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) classifiers are applied on the preprocessed data. The performance of generated classifier models is evaluated based on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, confusion matrix and ROC values. The results of optimal accuracy are 90.49%, 80.52% and 91.53% respectively. The comparative results manifest that restricted Boltzmann machine performs superior than the other techniques.""",,"""A.

"""R U There? Cell Phones, Participatory Design, and Intercultural Dialogue""","""Background: This case recounts my experiences during a four-year participatory design project with colleagues in Katanga Province of the Democratic Republic of Congo, where I attempted to develop a system for people working in rural areas to share business information via mobile phones. Research questions: For the first phase of this project: How do businesspeople in Katanga Province use their cell phones to support their business operations? How do they want to use these phones in their businesses? How do their use and attitudes compare with those of graduate students at a Midwestern US university? For the second phase of this project: Can a cell-phone delivered information system be designed for artisanal miners and small farmers in Katanga Province to share local pricing information for copper, cobalt, and maize? Situating the case: Researchers in participatory design for social and/or technological change have traditionally assumed that including users in early design phases will result in democratization of project outcomes. When these participatory design projects are situated in intercultural settings, however, they are complicated by political and economic conditions, as well as differences in values and social relations. Because participatory design relies on dialogue within robust, multimodal communication networks, weaknesses in this approach arise when trusted social relations are not in place upon which to build these multimodal communication networks. Cases of participatory design between colleagues in the US and Sub-Saharan Africa illustrate profound effects of political and economic inequities on participatory design projects. Methodology: This is an experience report of a project that developed initially from a classroom project in which my students in the US conducted a communication audit for a partner based in Katanga Province in the Democratic Republic of Congo. A US-based nongovernmental organization (NGO) arranged the partnership and I later went to the field to carry out this project. About the case: Working with an NGO while based exclusively in the US, we attempted to develop a system from which people working in rural areas could share business information, such as reporting business conditions in a rural location back to the NGO's Lubumbashi headquarters 75 km away, via mobile phones. The project did not work because people in Katanga were not familiar with the information design issues involved in the system and I was not familiar with the actual business situation at the NGO in Katanga. To address these issues, I traveled to the Democratic Republic of Congo and interviewed NGO staff and clients. But my presence in the NGO's Lubumbashi headquarters created irreparable social disruption. I continued the project with a new client in Katanga and revised goals for the information-sharing system, but that system, too, did not work for lack of a trusted social network of informants to participate in the information-sharing system. In the end, I was only able to complete an initial analysis of the needs. Conclusions: Despite the need to abandon the project, this case raised these questions about participatory design for information and communication technologies (ICT) projects when collaborators do not “speak the same language:” How can communication researchers effectively build trusted relationships with colleagues in developing nations in order to facilitate successful participatory design projects? Given the research obligations and reward structures at US universities, is it feasible for communication researchers to spend the time to build trusted relationships with colleagues in developing nations, which may not yield publishable research or quantifiable results for three years or more? Given the political and social conditions in many developing areas, can communication researchers rely on the stable conditions and personal relations that are necessary to conduct participatory design for ICT projects?""",,"""B.

"""A baseline study of potentially malicious activity across five network telescopes""","""This paper explores the Internet Background Radiation (IBR) observed across five distinct network telescopes over a 15 month period. These network telescopes consisting of a /24 netblock each and are deployed in IP space administered by TENET, the tertiary education network in South Africa covering three numerically distant /8 network blocks. The differences and similarities in the observed network traffic are explored. Two anecdotal case studies are presented relating to the MS08-067 and MS12-020 vulnerabilities in the Microsoft Windows platforms. The first of these is related to the Conficker worm outbreak in 2008, and traffic targeting 445/tcp remains one of the top constituents of IBR as observed on the telescopes. The case of MS12-020 is of interest, as a long period of scanning activity targeting 3389/tcp, used by the Microsoft RDP service, was observed, with a significant drop on activity relating to the release of the security advisory and patch. Other areas of interest are highlighted, particularly where correlation in scanning activity was observed across the sensors.

Results: 1) in terms of research power distribution, the United States is in the position of “outshining others”, which leads the research direction of the effect of modern wearable devices in sports to a certain extent. In terms of continents, the top two are North America and Europe. The region with a relatively weak research strength is Africa. The research strength in Asia is mainly concentrated in China, South Korea and Japan, while other regions are relatively weak, and the research quality in China needs to be improved. 2) The high-yield authors and teams of sports artificial intelligence research focus on American colleges and universities, with the main research direction of developing and improving intelligent wearable devices for different groups based on machine learning and deep learning technology. 3) Research disciplines, such as medicine, computer science and engineering, are the leading research on the effect of wearable devices in sports. The contribution rate of sports discipline to research on the effect of wearable devices in sports is relatively low, but it is consistent with the characteristics of interdisciplinary integration in this research field. 4) The hot spots of wearable devices in sports research are divided into four clusters, specifically wearable devices and related technologies, wearable device monitoring indicators, wearable device intervention behavior changes, and wearable device intervention effects. Sports form, crowds, wearable technology and methods, research methods, behavior change and result effects are the effective ways to study the intervention effect of wearable devices in sports.""",,"""Q.

"""Imagery-based modeling of social, economic, and governance indicators in sub-Saharan Africa""","""Many policy and national security challenges require understanding the social, cultural, and economic characteristics of a country or region. Addressing failing states, insurgencies, terrorist threats, societal change, and support for military operations require a detailed understanding of the local population. Information about the state of the economy, levels of community support and involvement, and attitudes toward government authorities can guide decision makers in developing and implementing policies or operations. However, such information is difficult to gather in remote, inaccessible, or denied areas. Draper's previous work demonstrating the application of remote sensing to specific issues, such as population estimation, agricultural analysis, and environmental monitoring, has been very promising. In recent papers, we extended these concepts to imagery-based prediction models for governance, well-being, and social capital. Social science theory indicates the relationships among physical structures, institutional features, and social structures. Based on these relationships, we developed models for rural Afghanistan and validated the relationships using survey data. In this paper we explore the adaptation of those models to sub-Saharan Africa. Our analysis indicates that, as in Afghanistan, certain attributes of the society are predictable from imagery-derived features. The automated extraction of relevant indicators, however, depends on both spatial and spectral information. Deriving useful measures from only panchromatic imagery poses some methodological challenges and additional research is needed.""",,"""J. Irvine; J. Kimball; J. Lepanto; J. Regan; R.

"""Face-Age Modeling: A Pattern Recognition Analysis for Age Estimation""","""This One way to explain the concept of face recognition is to see it as the computational ability engaged in verifying the identity of a person on the basis of the face image regardless of background, face-attachment, face-makeup and illumination. Face recognition has been researched and applied in real life problems such as security access controls, banking identity verification, immigrant verification and licensing. This study examines popular techniques and approaches involved in face recognition and its application in age estimation. The identification characteristics possessed by the face with other demographic information such as age, sex and ethnicity can be predicted using facial features extracted from facial images. The application of face recognition in these areas especially age estimation has not been richly researched. Consequently, this study presents an explorative write-up of face-age models with reference to the application of the commonly used face recognition technique to computationally achieve age prediction. In this study, it's germane to consider face recognition techniques since an important part of age estimation pipeline is the feature extraction which is also important in face recognition. This study shows that most of the researches in age estimation were tested with image taken under controlled or semi-controlled environment which are not sufficient to capture challenges in real life conditions. It was observed that most existing researches uses FG-NET and MORPH 2 face database in testing age estimation systems with scarcity of black face feature across several existing systems. However, more work is desirable, owing to failure of some system to accurately recognize or identify specific faces or using long turnaround processing time for identification vis-a-vise age estimation. This calls for the development of robust black-face database for local testing and implementation among African population. It is also evident that more work is required to show the interaction of epigenetics and its analysis in face-age modeling.""",,"""O. Oladipo; I. P. Osamor; V. C. Osamor; T. N. Abiodun; A. O.

"""Stand-Alone, Affordable IoT Satellite Terminals and Their Opportunistic Use for Rain Monitoring""","""Internet of Things (IoT) communication via satellite is an important emerging technology, which is essential for a variety of applications such as agriculture, financial technology, and homeland security in rural or isolated areas. In this article, we deal with two-way low cost, stand-alone IoT satellite terminals communicating over geostationary satellites at Ku-band frequencies, already deployed in isolated areas in Africa and South America. On top of their designated use for specific IoT applications, we suggest using such terminals for opportunistic rain monitoring, based on the two-way link quality measurements that are being regularly collected for network management purposes. The local $E_{s}/N_{0}$ measurements are transmitted to the cloud, where their transformation to rain-intensity estimates is carried out. We present preliminary results using real measurements, showing good agreement with direct rainfall measurements recorded by a rain gauge. Enabling this feature in two-way communication of IoT satellite terminals is beneficial, as it will provide the ability to monitor the rain in areas where designated weather monitoring equipment is sparse, helping to improve local weather-based applications in such areas, and to better track the climate change globally.""",,"""J.

As a consequence, the radiofrequency (RF) spectrum is becoming a very valuable but scarce natural resource. In relation to this, it is well known that some portions of the RF spectrum, such as those assigned to military and emergency services, remain underutilized. These spectral holes, usually referred as ""white spaces,"" then become excellent opportunities for new wireless communications and radar systems to operate. Nevertheless, the necessary dynamic access to properly exploit these free spectral holes can only be performed through very sophisticated and reliable receiver architectures.

"""Semi-Supervised Machine Learning for Livestock Threat Classification Using GPS Data""","""South African livestock farmers face major challenges in the form of livestock theft and predation. In response to these concerns, farmers started using a collar that monitors the acceleration of an animal and, when specific parameters are met, triggers an alarm which transmits GPS data to the user’s mobile application. Typically, a collar is placed on one animal per flock or herd. In this work, we aim to classify the GPS trajectories captured by these devices into four categories: theft, predation, own-handling and other. We lay particular emphasis on distinguishing theft alarms since these have direct implications for the safety and financial sustainability of farmers. To date, just over one million of these alarms have been recorded. Unfortunately, these trajectories are not labelled with the four categories. Therefore, we start by collecting labelled data sets that can be used for training classification models. We then investigate supervised and semi-supervised approaches for classifying the trajectories. Our semi-supervised approach shows the best results with performance comparable to human performance. The approach consists of three parts. First, an autoencoder and classifier are jointly trained to produce fixed-dimensional embeddings from GPS trajectories. Second, these embeddings are clustered to produce cluster labels. And lastly, the cluster labels are added to human-engineered features and used to train a final classifier. Our semi-supervised approach achieves an overall classification accuracy of 69%, with an F1 score of 56% for theft events (4% lower than human performance) and an F1 score of 90% for own-handling events (slightly outperforming a human). This model can be deployed to aid farmers in terms of safety and security by providing them with critical information in emergency situations.""",,"""U. J. De Swardt; H.

"""Measurements and Analysis of Large-Scale Path Loss Model at 14 and 22 GHz in Indoor Corridor""","""Fifth generation wireless communications will exploit the enormous chunk of bandwidth available at millimeter-wave frequency bands. Accordingly, an accurate and simple path loss model is critical for indoor environments, where deployment is likely to occur. We conducted measurement campaigns in the 14 and 22 GHz frequency bands in a typical indoor corridor environment on 5th floor of the Discipline of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering building, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Howard Campus, South Africa. This paper presents details of measurement campaigns with unique transmitter-receiver combinations using a costume-designed channel sounder. The acquired measurement results provide large-scale path loss statistics in an open-plan indoor environment in line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight conditions. An effective application of dual slope single-frequency directional large-scale path loss model is evaluated based on the acquired measurement data. The application of dual slope large-scale path loss model is supported by a comprehensive analysis and consideration of propagation mechanisms, such as reflection and diffraction resulting in modal attenuation. Validated results show that dual slope large-scale path loss model applied in this paper outperforms close-in reference distance model that assumes the impact of propagating wave guiding effect in indoor corridors.""",,"""N.

"""A robust preprocessing algorithm for iris segmentation from low contrast eye images""","""Iris recognition systems offer highly accurate personal identification both on small and very-large scale systems needed in government, forensic and commercial applications. The automatic segmentation of a noise-free iris region is imperative for optimal performance of the system. However, image characteristics such as brightness and contrast, the differing levels of pigmentation, occlusion by eyelashes and/or eyelids, coupled with varying sensor and environmental conditions, makes iris segmentation a huge and difficult task. This paper proposes an image pre-processing algorithm for robust iris segmentation of low contrast images, aimed at reducing mis-localization errors of basic curve-fitting algorithms. Similar to face detection, the algorithm performs iris detection with a k-NN classifier trained with features extracted by a rotation-invariant texture descriptor based on the co-occurrence of local binary patterns. The integration of the proposed algorithm into an existing open-source iris segmentation module offered a 40% improvement in execution time; a segmentation accuracy of 92% was also recorded over 1,898 low contrast eye images acquired from African subjects. The low contrast eye images were acquired to support diversity in iris recognition.""",,"""J. A. Badejo; A. A. Atayero; T. S.

"""A Visual Analytics Framework for Spatiotemporal Trade Network Analysis""","""Economic globalization is increasing connectedness among regions of the world, creating complex interdependencies within various supply chains. Recent studies have indicated that changes and disruptions within such networks can serve as indicators for increased risks of violence and armed conflicts. This is especially true of countries that may not be able to compete for scarce commodities during supply shocks. Thus, network-induced vulnerability to supply disruption is typically exported from wealthier populations to disadvantaged populations. As such, researchers and stakeholders concerned with supply chains, political science, environmental studies, etc. need tools to explore the complex dynamics within global trade networks and how the structure of these networks relates to regional instability. However, the multivariate, spatiotemporal nature of the network structure creates a bottleneck in the extraction and analysis of correlations and anomalies for exploratory data analysis and hypothesis generation. Working closely with experts in political science and sustainability, we have developed a highly coordinated, multi-view framework that utilizes anomaly detection, network analytics, and spatiotemporal visualization methods for exploring the relationship between global trade networks and regional instability.

"""Streamlined approach to online banking authentication in South Africa and Europe""","""Online banking now requires additional levels of authentication in order to prevent fraudulent transactions. The first, and still most prevalent, method of authentication in South Africa makes use of the mobile phone. By using an SMS to send a one-time password, or Push USSD to immediately require action from the user, the online bank system attempts to verify the authenticity of the transaction. Newer methods, particularly found in Europe, make use of specialised devices that incorporate existing bank tokens, i.e. chip card, to further validate any online transactions. Both of these methods have security defects and usability issues. A new method that uses the best of the approaches and includes additional factors, e.g. biometrics, is explored.""",,"""F. Blauw; S.

"""Quantified H I morphology – I. Multi-wavelength analysis of the THINGS galaxies""","""Galaxy evolution is driven to a large extent by interactions and mergers with other galaxies and the gas in galaxies is extremely sensitive to the interactions. One method to measure such interactions uses the quantified morphology of galaxy images. Well-established parameters are Concentration, Asymmetry, Smoothness, Gini and M20 of a galaxy image. Thus far, the application of this technique has mostly been restricted to rest-frame ultraviolet and optical images. However, with the new radio observatories being commissioned [South African Karoo Array Telescope (MeerKAT), Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP), Extended Very Large Array (EVLA), Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope/APERture Tile In Focus instrument (WSRT/APERTIF) and ultimately the Square Kilometer Array (SKA)], a new window on the neutral atomic hydrogen gas (H I) morphology of large numbers of galaxies will open up. The quantified morphology of gas discs of spirals can be an alternative indicator of the level and frequency of interaction. The H I in galaxies is typically spatially more extended and more sensitive to low-mass or weak interactions.In this paper, we explore six morphological parameters calculated over the extent of the stellar (optical) disc and the extent of the gas disc for a range of wavelengths spanning ultraviolet (UV), optical, near- and far-infrared and 21 cm (H I) of 28 galaxies from The H I Nearby Galaxy Survey (THINGS). Although the THINGS sample is small and contains only a single ongoing interaction, it spans both non-interacting and post-interacting galaxies with a wealth of multi-wavelength data. We find that the choice of area for the computation of the morphological parameters is less of an issue than the wavelength at which they are measured. The signal of interaction is as good in the H I as at any of the other wavelengths at which morphology has been used to trace the interaction rate to date, mostly star formation dominated ones (near- and far-ultraviolet). The Asymmetry and M20 parameters are the ones that show the most promise as tracers of interaction in 21 cm line observations.""",,"""B. W. Holwerda; N. Pirzkal; W. J. G. de Blok; A. Bouchard; S. -.

"""An open-water electrical geophysical tool for mapping sub-seafloor heavy placer minerals in 3D and migrating hydrocarbon plumes in 4D""","""A towed-streamer technology has been developed for mapping placer heavy minerals and dispersed hydrocarbon plumes in the open ocean. The approach uses induced polarization (IP), an electrical measurement that encompasses several different surface-reactive capacitive and electrochemical phenomena, and thus is ideally suited for mapping dispersed or disseminated targets. The application is operated at sea by towing active electrical geophysical streamers behind a ship; a wide area can be covered in three dimensions by folding tow-paths over each other in lawn-mower fashion. This technology has already been proven in laboratory and ocean settings to detect IP-reactive titanium- and rare-earth (REE) minerals such as ilmenite and monazite. By extension, minerals that weather and accumulate/concentrate by a similar mechanism, including gold, platinum, and diamonds, may be rapidly detected and mapped indirectly- even when dispersed and covered with thick, inert sediment. IP is also highly reactive to metal structures such as pipelines and cables. Currently, the only means for mapping an oil-spill plume is to park a large ship in the ocean and drop a sampling string over the side, requiring hours of time per sampling point. The samples must then be chemically analyzed, adding additional time and expense. We believe that an extension of the marine IP technology could also apply to rapidly mapping both seafloor- blanket and disseminated hydrocarbon plumes in the open ocean, as hydrocarbon droplets in conductive seawater are topologically equivalent to a metal-plates-and-dielectric capacitor. Because the effective capacitance would be frequency-dependent on droplet size, the approach we advocate holds the potential to not only map, but also to characterize the evolution and degradation of such a plume over time. In areas where offshore oil field development has been practiced for extended periods, making IP measurements from a towed streamer may be useful for locating buried and exposed pipelines, as well as pipeline leaks. We believe this technique will be a more cost-effective method than drop-sampling to map and monitor hydrocarbon plumes in open ocean settings. A marine induced polarization system was used successfully to map a 15 km × 45 km swath of the ocean floor off eastern South Africa with 3-meter sampling along 200-meter-separated profiles. The survey detected titanium-bearing sands up to 15 meters below the seafloor. From preliminary laboratory work it is apparent that we can extend this technology to monitor significant environmental problems including anthropogenic and industrial waste washed into sensitive estuaries and sounds during storm-water runoff episodes, and also to map and characterize dispersed oil plumes in the seawater column in three dimensions, as well as movement and dispersal of both over time.""",,"""J.

"""Clear-Air Anomaly Masking Using Kalman Temporal Filter From Geostationary Multispectral Imagery""","""An anomaly detection and estimation technique, using a pixel-based modified version of the Kalman temporal filter, is presented. To detect the anomalies of the observed variable, the proposed Kalman-based anomaly masking (KAM) algorithm relies on the background state models of the expected measurement cycle of each pixel in nominal (abnormal) conditions. If the measurement significantly deviates from its expected value as predicted by a priori state, an anomaly is identified. The KAM algorithm also provides an a priori estimate of the nominal scenario, exploiting the previous Kalman filter states. The product is an equivalent clear-air observation, expected to be measured in the absence of anomaly (e.g., in the absence of cloud coverage). The KAM algorithm exhibits a general applicability, since its estimates are empirically computed from pixel-based models and its thresholds can be set independently of the area of interest. An application of the KAM algorithm to clear-air nominal scenarios is shown using multispectral imagery from the geostationary Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager, having 12 visible-infrared channels and repeat cycle of 15 min, on board of the Meteosat satellite. The area of interest covers the whole West Africa for a test period of three months (December 2015 until February 2016). This results in a massive amount of processed pixels (i.e., 1530 × 880 pixels for 96 timeslots per day). A validation of the clear-air KAM algorithm is presented by intercomparing the detection results with the well-known EUMETSAT cloud mask product. The validation shows constant percentages of matching around 90% over the entire period of analysis.""",,"""L. Milani; M. Arcorace; G. Rivolta; R. Cuccu; F. S.

"""Evaluating Land Surface Moisture Conditions Before and After Flash-Flood Storm from Optical and Thermal Data: Models Comparison and Validation""","""Soil moisture (SM) is an important physical parameter for several hydrological and agricultural applications, weather and climate predictions, as well as early warning of natural hazards such as flood and drought. It varies significantly in space and time, and it is a challenge to map its variations accurately at the regional and local scales. The aim of the present study is a comparison and validation of four models such as NDWI, SIWSI, TOTRAM and OPTRAM for SM mapping before and after flash-flood storm in arid land. The used methodology exploits two pairs of images acquired with Landsat-OLI/TIRS sensors over the study area before and after flood. The first pair was acquired two weeks before the flash flood, and the second one was collected eight days after the flood. These images were radiometrically and atmospherically corrected, as well topographically rectified using SRTM DEM. For validation purposes, before and after storm, two independent SM products were used. Both, they were derived from data acquired simultaneously with those recorded by Landsat-OLI/TIRS. The first is derived from SMOS data, and the second is compiled from rainfall data (SM-RFE) delivered by NOAA climate prediction center RFE (Rainfall Estimator) for Africa. The results revealed that TOTRAM and NDWI models converge towards the same conclusions describing accurately the drastic change of SM before and after flash-flood highlighting the impact of inundation and the mud accumulation over the study area. Their results validation against those of SMOS and SM-RFE products shows a significant agreement (R2 of 0.95). However, in addition to its simplicity and to its easy implementation, the NDWI show a great potential for SM content estimation independently of LST using only optical data such as Landsat-OLI or Sentinel-MSI.""",,"""A.

"""Hydrotope-Based Protocol to Determine Average Soil Moisture Over Large Areas for Satellite Calibration and Validation With Results From an Observation Campaign in the Volta Basin, West Africa""","""In West Africa, which is an extremely moisture-limited region, soil water information plays a vital role in hydrologic and meteorologic modeling for improved water resource planning and food security. Recent and upcoming satellite missions, such as SMOS and MetOp, hold promise for the regional observation of soil moisture. The resolution of the satellites is relatively coarse (>100 km2), which brings with it the need for large-scale soil moisture information for calibration and validation purposes. We put forward a soil moisture sampling protocol based on hydrotopes. Hydrotopes are defined as landscape units that show internally consistent hydrologic behavior. This hydrotope analysis helps in the following ways: 1) by ensuring statistically reliable validation via the reduction of the overall pixel variance and 2) by improving sampling schemes for ground truthing by reducing the chance of sampling bias. As a sample application, we present data from three locations with different moisture regimes within the Volta Basin during both dry and wet periods. Results show that different levels of reduction in the overall pixel variance of soil moisture are obtained, depending on the general moisture status. With respect to the distinction between the different hydrotope units, it is shown that under intermediate moisture conditions, the distinction between the different hydrotope units is highest, whereas extremely dry or wet conditions tend to have a homogenizing effect on the spatial soil moisture distribution. This paper confirms that well-defined hydrotope units yield an improvement at pixel-scale soil moisture averages that can easily be applied.""",,"""J. Friesen; C. Rodgers; P. G. Oguntunde; J. M. H.

A promising approach to provide this information at farm level is a low-cost optical spectroscopy device and an accompanying decision support application. This paper describes our efforts to explore spectral libraries, both publicly accessible and acquired through our own efforts, to define the instrument specifications and data handling procedures for such an approach. Spectral ranges throughout the mid-infrared (MIR) and near-infrared (NIR) regions and spectral resolution pertinent to available hardware technologies were evaluated. Given the complex physical-chemical properties of soil samples, numerous preprocessing strategies were applied prior to regression with partial least squares, support vector machine, and multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) models for predicting relevant soil properties. The experiments with existing spectral datasets demonstrated that the MLPNN approach outperformed other approaches most consistently for soil property prediction, and that the MIR region offers better performance than NIR, even with truncated spectral ranges and degraded spectral resolutions. At this time, however, there are hardware limitations for MIR systems that prevent a low cost device from collecting acceptable signals, thus making an NIR solution more appealing overall.""",,"""W.

"""Remote Vegetation Diagnostics in Ghana with a Hyperspectral Fluorescence Lidar""","""Spectral imaging and lidar methods for the characterization of vegetation are vital for understanding plants and, in turn, food security, biodiversity, and vegetation health in a changing climate. While novel hyperspectral imaging, canopy lidar, and solar-induced fluorescence provide details on species, state, structure, and plant physiology, such data come from different instruments. Thus, post-processing and data fusion struggles with synchronization, spatial overlap, and resolution issues. Especially in the tropical regions of sub-Saharan Africa, these complex, expensive, and bulky instruments remain inaccessible. Here, in Ghana, we have built a low-cost, lightweight, and realistic instrument for simultaneously acquiring hyperspectral data of vegetation fluorescence and canopy structure with perfect spatial overlap. In this paper, we demonstrate the application of the hyperspectral fluorescence lidar for diagnostics and species specificity of locally significant crops. We demonstrate simultaneous range and fluorescence measurements of forest canopy, conducted in full sunlight. Our results indicate that the upper side of the leaves shows a more substantial deviation for stressed plants, while the lower side shows greater contrast for plant species.

"""Rock magnetism and palaeomagnetism of the Oddanchatram anorthosite, Tamil Nadu, South India""","""Rock magnetic and palaeomagnetic data are reported on the Proterozoic massif-type anorthosite body from Oddanchatram, on the northern slopes of the Kodaikanal (Palani) Ranges, Tamil Nadu. Alternating field demagnetization treatment indicated a very stable direction of magnetization. Progressive heating revealed a remanence that became unblocked at 580°C. The demagnetization analysis yields a characteristic component with a mean direction: Dm= 97.3° Im =− 28.8° (k= 51, α95= 7.2° and N= 9 sites). In addition to this characteristic component, specimens from a few sites show the presence of a low coercivity component with a mean palaeomagnetic direction of D= 36.7° I=−29.4° (k= 63, α95= 4.4° and N= 18). The isothermal remanent magnetization acquisition curves indicate magnetite as the main carrier of the stable remanence. The direction of the characteristic component corresponds to a pole position at 9.7°N, 1.7°E (dp= 4.4°, dm= 7.9°). The location of this pole is comparable to palaeomagnetic poles reported for the period of 1100–1000 Ma for a range of formations from the Indian shield. The pole for the secondary component (45°S, 23°E) fits well with poles for 550 Ma, associated with the Pan-African thermal event that extensively caused granulite grade metamorphism in the Southern Granulite Terrain. Despite the high temperature (>700 °C) that prevailed during the Pan-African event, the remanence magnetization of 1100–1000 Ma is preserved in the Oddanchatram anorthosite. It is inferred that the northern boundary of the terrain affected by the dominant 550 Ma granulitic metamorphism lies close to the southern margin of the Oddanchatram anorthosite body. Thus Oddanchatram anorthosite escaped the high temperatures metamorphism. The weak secondary magnetization found in a few specimens is attributed to hydrothermal activity associated with the intrusion of pink granites, immediately south of the Oddanchatram anorthosite body. A mid-Proterozoic magnetization age of the Oddanchatram anorthosite supports the view that this body was emplaced/remobilized during the Eastern Ghat Orogeny (∼1000 Ma) and this body can be seen as a western extension of the string of massif-type anorthosites in the Eastern Ghat Mobile Belt.""",,"""K.

Continuous investment in up-to-date security measures and technologies helps to prevent heavy financial and information loses that may be caused by cyber-attacks. The growth of cyber-crimes is becoming a serious economic issue to South African organizations in particular and the country as a whole. This paper begins by analyzing the various cyber threats involved in cyber banking. Secondly, it proposes a cyber-banking security architecture, with the boundary and application security. The boundary security architecture comprises of four components and the application security proposes strategies to avoid vulnerabilities. Lastly this paper proposes a cyber-banking security framework to be adopted by financial institutions.""",,"""T. M. Mbelli; B.

"""Users' Perceptions on Security of Mobile Computing for Adoption of e-Applications in South Africa""","""Technology development particularly in the area of mobile computing revolutionize the way business is done and the way people conduct their daily activities. However, users' perceptions can play an important role towards the adoption of these new developments. The quantitative approach was used to conduct the study by using a survey questionnaire. The model used in this study was derived from Diffusion of Innovation and Technology Adoption Model 2. The sampling is convenient. Data collected in this study were analyzed with the help of various statistical measures such as reliability using Cronbach's alpha, principal component analysis, Pearson correlations analysis and multiple linear regression. The empirical study shows that the adoption of e-applications in South Africa are influenced by the perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and subjective on security mechanisms. Results also show that all variables were confirmed to be correlated to each other.

"""Mobile banking and information security risks: Demand-side predilections of South African lead-users""","""South Africa's lead-users predilections to tinker and innovate mobile banking services is driven by various constructs. Advanced technologies have made mobile banking services easy to use, attractive and beneficial. While this is welcome news to many, there are concerns that when lead-users tinker with these services, information security risks are exacerbated. The aim of this article is to present an insightful understanding of the demand-side predilections of South Africa's lead-users in such contexts. We assimilate the theories of Usage Control, (UCON), the Theory of Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), and the Theory of Perceived Risk (TPP) to explain predilections over technology. We demonstrate that constructs derived from these theories can explain the general demand-side predilection to tinker with mobile banking services. A quantitative approach was used to test this. From a sample of South African banking lead-users operating in Gauteng province of South Africa, data was collected and analysed with the help of a software package. We found unexpectedly that, lead-users predilections to tinker with mobile banking services was inhibited by perceived risk. Moreover, male lead-users were more domineering in the tinkering process than female lead-users. The implication for this is discussed and explained in the main body of work.""",,"""K. Njenga; S.

"""The development of a mobile information system to assess the food security of rural communities in South Africa""","""While South Africa has the means to be food secure, poverty and unemployment cause 20% of households to be food insecure, mostly in rural areas. Little is known about key factors that influence food security, such as the sources of food of rural households and the relationship between local food production and dietary quality. To this end, a study was commissioned by the South African Water Research Commission (WRC). A quantitative data collection tool was required to collect data related to food security and rural diets. The initial paper-based survey process was error-prone, hence a mobile application was introduced for electronic data capturing. This study concerns the development process of the mobile data capturing system. It is shown how, through a number of development iterations, the system led to significant improvements in the nutrition project's data capturing process. The study demonstrates the value of a responsive IS development process that caters for local needs and constraints, and is hence able to provide appropriate technology to support food security decision-making in South Africa.""",,"""C. van der Merwe; M.

"""Studies on Security Threats in Waste Mobile Phone Recycling Supply Chain in India""","""The presence of different metals and rare earth elements in the smart phones have made waste mobile phone recycling economically suitable. In order to maintain the equilibrium of resource exploitation and enhance resource efficiency, it is important to recycle mobile sustainably. Increasing environmental and data loss threats have enforced several policies to increase the recycling rate. Despite all, a small fraction of waste mobile phones are recycled properly and a significant amount mobile phones are refurbished and repaired which enters the second-hand market. The secondhand market is a critical node in the supply chain of waste mobile phone. The data security issues arise from this area and it varies with the amount of time it spends in the repairing zone. A lot of valuable and sensitive data are saved in storage units of a mobile phone. Improper disposal of waste mobile phone can lead to potential threat of exposing personal information from the devices, including logged in profile details of social networking sites, emails, personal messages, photos etc. This can lead to cyber risks including identity theft, data tampering, information disclosure etc. which may have higher social impact. General issues with data security from ewaste have been reported. Studies focusing on threats from used, lost or improperly discarded mobile phones are scant. In this study, we identify such issues pertaining in the supply chain of waste mobile phones. Possible solutions have been proposed to address these issues. A supply-chain based framework has been proposed which can serve as a prima facie towards development of a detailed solution architecture.""",,"""B. Debnath; A. Das; S. Das; A.

"""Application of very high-resolution satellite imagery for vulnerability assessment in mega cities: A case study in Delhi/India""","""The 21st century is the century of the cities and of urbanization. Mega cities in rapidly urbanizing regions are hot spots of demographic and socio-economic dynamics. Their rapid growth results in uncontrolled processes of fragmentation. Due to the high dynamics of mega cities, the traditional methods such as statistical analyses or fieldwork are limited to capture the urban process. Remote sensing provides the opportunity to monitor spatial patterns of urban structures with high spatial and temporal resolution. VHR remote sensing data from the QuickBird sensor are used to identify urban structures and dynamics within Delhi/India. The paper presents a first semi- automated, object-based classification approach which allows the distinction of different settlement types within the urban area. Thereby the research is focused on the identification of ""informal settlements"". In order to find out whether VHR remote sensing data can provide indicators to identify socio-economic structures and dynamics, the classification results were embedded in an analysis concept. By combining remote sensing derived data with questionnaire information, it is possible to calculate specific population and water related parameters. This is understood to be a first step to the development of indicators which will help to identify and understand the different forms, actors and processes of vulnerability in mega cities.""",,"""S.

Due to the complexity of the present SIM card registration process, the subscribers are reluctant to register themselves. In this paper we propose a cloud based system model which demonstrates an online method of SIM card purchasing and registration. This system model conquers the constraints of the conventional system of mobile purchasing and registration which is lengthy and stalking. It enables the subscriber to buy the SIM card and to be registered in an uncomplicated way. Here we mainly emphasize on the security issue through mandatory mobile SIM card registration. The purpose of our system model is lessening the rate of crimes which can be taken place by the use of mobile.

"""On the MitM vulnerability in mobile banking applications for android devices""","""One of the primary concerns that the developers of mobile banking applications should strive to is to ensure the security of user information originating from any of these applications. However, implementing even basic security features, like performing encryption on user data or using HTTPS while connection establishment, on such mobile applications, is often found to be absent either due to the lack of knowledge of user security concerns, or unavailability of security testing experts who can point out the security flaws in the applications. In this paper, we consider man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack, a simple yet powerful attack, as a primary attack to test basic security features that a mobile banking application should impose. We have considered a total of 19 mobile banking applications on Android that are currently got deployed by public sector banks in India and are used by their respective customers. Surprisingly, the In about 90% of these banking applications, we have observed that the attack can be launched with ease even if the applications are using security protocols like HTTPS to establish a communication channel with their respective servers. Moreover, some mobile applications are using simple HTTP protocol to transfer user information without bothering anything about security. Hence, our analysis suggests that a level of revision is required to address the basic security flaws in the mobile banking applications to prevent even simple MitM attack.""",,"""S. Kaka; V. N.

"""Effective Security Testing of Mobile Applications for Building Trust in the Digital World""","""In recent years, mobile applications have become increasingly important. These applications differ significantly from desktop and web applications, and being used increasingly in various enterprise domains. Accordingly, this motivates the mobile industries to increase the accessibility of mobile applications and their development across many platforms, including Android and iPhone. This research work discusses the security testing procedure and features of India's first indigenous AppStore “mSeva AppStore”. To ensure the quality of the hosted mobile applications, distinct techniques, and effective testing approaches are required. Before hosting the application on mSeva AppStore regressive testing is performed in all aspects like insecure permissions, data storage, secure logic, proper platform algorithms, etc. However, in the current mobile application testing scenario, other AppStore does not consider all factors before hosting the applications, which is quite necessary. This study highlights the key terminologies of mobile application testing and quality parameters. Further, demonstrates the actual results that are obtained during the security testing of various applications. Along with this, the first-ever Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) based classification regarding common artifacts in mobile application testing is provided.

"""Towards Formal Modeling and Analysis of UPI Protocols""","""UPI (Unified Payments Interface) is a framework in India wherein customers can send payments to merchants from their smartphones. The framework consists of UPI servers that are connected to the banks at the sender and receiver ends. To send and receive payments, customers and merchants would have to first register themselves with UPI servers by executing a registration protocol using payment apps such as BHIM, PayTm, Google Pay, and PhonePe. Weaknesses were recently reported on these protocols that allow attackers to make money transfers on behalf of innocent customers and even empty their bank accounts. But the reported weaknesses were found after informal and manual analysis. However, as history has shown, formal analysis of cryptographic protocols often reveals flaws that could not be discovered with manual inspection. In this paper, we model UPI protocols in the pattern of traditional cryptographic protocols such that they can be rigorously studied and analyzed using formal methods. The modeling simplifies many of the complexities in the protocols, making it suitable to analyze and verify UPI protocols with popular analysis and verification tools such as the Constraint Solver, ProVerif and Tamarin. Our modeling could also be used as a general framework to analyze and verify many other financial payment protocols than just UPI protocols, giving it a broader applicability.""",,"""S.

"""Evaluating Performance of Web Application Security Through a Fuzzy Based Hybrid Multi-Criteria Decision-Making Approach: Design Tactics Perspective""","""Design of software can have a major impact on the overall security of the software. Developing a secure website design is a challenge for architectures. It depends on different and tough decisions which determine the security of website. Increasing number of vulnerabilities increase the level of security requirements. Hence, security design tactics are to be adopted to satisfy these security requirements. Security design tactics are the mechanisms to define, detect and mitigate vulnerabilities and attacks. Therefore, faults in the application of security tactics or their weakening during website maintenance could be one of the key reasons behind the emergence of new and severe vulnerabilities that can be targeted by the hackers. There is a need for in-depth analysis of security tactics and its prioritization for the sake of determining the most prioritized factor. This will further help in gaining a more secure system. In this research study, the authors have used the hybrid method of Fuzzy AHP-TOPSIS (Analytic Hierarchy Process-Technique for Order Preference by Similarity Ideal Solution) for the evaluation of security design tactics and its attributes. The efficiency of this approach has been tested on a real time web application of Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University, Lucknow, India.

The aim of the paper is to define DDoS scope, classifications and opportunities for assailants who use IoT to conduct such operations and to use IoT in healthcare. The research approach is to analyze DDoS, IoT and the use of IoT literature in the health sector. The study found that DDOS attacks on IoT-specific devices have become a very easy phenomenon because network attacks are much simpler due to limited security protocols. IOT distribution companies have made limited efforts to enable security of these devices and protecting the data, thus making them susceptible to vulnerabilities. Due to weak security layers, the confidentiality, authenticity and integrity of private data collected by IoT devices are threatened by attackers. The current research identified the gap and importance for further research to provide a mechanism for detection and prevention of DDOS attack in the application layer of IoT healthcare devices in India.

There may be instances where we want to contact someone nearby and we do not have their contact details, in such a situation our app plays a crucial role in the communication. To overcome this, we came up with an idea of making an app which will use the location/GPS of a user’s device to locate nearby users. We are also aware that the privacy policy of most of the popular apps state that they would sync our data with their parent company for advertisement purposes. Old chatting applications lack security, and the addition of more security layers is our major priority.

"""A Qualitative Analysis for Implementing Supply Chain Risk Management Practices in Bangladesh in the Event of Earthquake""","""While Bangladesh is a developing nation, the country's economy regularly suffers in the aftermath of a natural disaster, such as an earthquake, due to the significant number of severe deaths and economic destruction. Bangladesh's supply chain management framework, notably in the services industry, is insufficient. The study's goal is to portray a scenario in which an earthquake destroys both the economy and the people of Bangladesh. However, the country's building industry is rapidly increasing. This research aims to analyze the application of supply chain risk management and its implementation in Bangladesh. This research studied and highlighted difficulties in handling the present earthquake situation in Bangladesh at all phases of operation. In addition, the methodology used to answer the research question is mentioned. It is also intended to create and maintain an effective earthquake emergency supply chain. A systematic SWOT (Strength, Weakness, Opportunities and Threat) analysis was conducted to understand better and obtain a real scenario of supply chain management in Bangladesh and how one may use this method and tackle the issues. The article also emphasizes the limits and offers a way for overcoming them. The purpose of this study is to assist policymakers in selecting this criterion for establishing advanced supply chain risk management to minimize damage to people and the economy.

"""Prakruthi Sedhya: A Natural Farming Mobile App""","""Andhra Pradesh Community Natural Farming (APCNF) is an organization that promotes natural farming. Their farming techniques are low-cost and eco-friendly and include the use of local resources. Natural farming has the ability to achieve the twin objectives of ensuring global food security and environmental preservation because it does not rely on agrochemicals. The Andhra Pradesh government has initiated Rythu Sadhikara Samstha (RySS), which occasionally conducts village-level training on natural farming techniques through SHG and RySS groups. But, it is still unknown to many people and has no support to assist them. We have designed this Prakruthi Sedhya application, a complete Natural Farming Mobile app. Our motto is to help people by assisting them in farming and creating a network among them. This app provides details about cultivating different crops, using natural farming techniques, and crop care information, including preparing natural fertilizers and using them at appropriate times. Furthermore, it indicates the weather forecast in each region. It also includes details about government schemes and minimum support prices(MSP) of all crops, fixed by the central government of India. This application connects farmers and buyers so that farmers can sell their yield directly to customers. Building a network among farmers through discussion forums can also be met. This app was created using real data that was gathered from APCNF specialists, agriculture officers, and active farmers.

"""Cloud Computing and Crowdsourcing for Monitoring Lakes in Developing Countries""","""Lake pollution is a major and growing environmental threat in developing countries, exacerbated by the lack of ongoing scientific data about health of lakes. One way to address this problem is to crowdsource monitoring of lakes to interested citizens. We investigated changes in a lake in Bangalore, India over three months and found that there was double digit percentage change in several chemical and physical parameters, confirming that frequent monitoring of lakes would be valuable. We went on to develop an integrated mobile phone app and lake monitoring kit consisting of an electronic sensing device and chemical test strips. The electronic device measures total dissolved solids, electrical conductivity, and temperature of a water sample, and transmits this data to a mobile app. The app also measures contaminant concentration levels of pH, Hardness, Alkalinity, Copper, and Nitrites by detecting color changes in chemical test strips. All data collected by the app is uploaded to a cloud platform that enables spatiotemporal visualizations of health parameters of multiple lakes.

"""Automated Security Testing Framework for Validating Content Rights On Video Streaming Devices""","""Proliferation of high speed internet services and mass adoption of smart phones and internet enabled smart devices has led to a meteoritic rise in streaming video services around the globe. As streaming audio-video content takes center-stage in this digital era, “Cut-the-Cord” phenomenon has gained significant momentum all over the globe. New streaming models like Over-the-Top (OTT) services have disrupted this industry globally. OTT platforms like Netflix, Amazon Prime, YouTube, Sony Crackle, BBC iPlayer have gained lot of market share in the recent years. In India alone, there are more than 40 video streaming services [1] like Hotstar, AirtelTV, Voot, Sony Liv, JioTV and the list is growing by the day. However, streaming video applications, face constant challenges with respect to security of content rights across the streaming value chain. A leading global research firm KPMG, in a recent report suggests that, global streaming players could suffer losses of over 50 billion dollars (USD) due to pirated content in the next few years. Similarly a recent report released by FICCI highlights the fact that, upto 30% of overall film sector revenue in India has been lost due to piracy alone. As millions of internet videos get streamed on various consumer devices, risks of security breaches, online piracy and video hacking, pose considerable challenge for the entire video streaming industry. Therefore, it becomes absolutely essential for the video content creators, aggregators and distributors to adopt best-in-class secure development methodologies along with cutting edge security testing techniques to protect digital video assets. This requires special focus beyond traditional quality assurance (QA) and conventional security testing techniques like Pen Testing, Vulnerability Assessment etc. In this paper we propose a unique automated security testing framework focusing on critical aspects of the video streaming domain. In-order to provide a holistic model for enhancing cyber security aspects of streaming video systems, we expanded our earlier research work [3], [4] to cover latest content security concepts like Digital Rights Management (DRM), High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP).

"""A Novel CNN-Based Approach for Intelligent Garbage Detection and Localization""","""In India, the problem of waste management is one of the most critical concern as tonnes of waste is generated every year of which only a very minute percentage is treated. The rest of it is either are not treated properly or dumped in landfills. Governments around the world have extensively tried to develop intelligent waste or garbage management techniques. The potential threat to sanitation, public health and safety caused by improper waste management is immense. In light of rapid increase in computational efficiency as neural networks became more capable of processing deeper data, deep learning was inevitable for garbage management systems. This paper attempts to provide an end-to-end solution to automating the process of garbage detection and alerts, beginning right at the source. The solution proposed comprises employing a highly accurate training strategy using the acclaimed VGG-16 network using a subset of the COCO dataset and also includes an accompanying Android app that makes the process of garbage localization and alerts seamless and effective. Finally, we guide you through our mobile application that is designed to assist municipalities in remotely monitoring garbage accumulation areas which help to take appropriate measures to keep surrounding areas clean and hygienic.

"""Quantum cryptography based solution for secure and efficient key management for e-Governance in India""","""Secure key distribution is the fundamental problem in traditional symmetric key cryptography. Many techniques came into existence to safeguard key distribution. The core functionality of a key management technique is to share a secret key between two parties in secure and efficient fashion. This is the most important concern when cryptography is integrated with a communication network. Adversaries can exploit vulnerabilities in key management mechanism. Quantum key distribution is a promising technique that ensures unconditionally secure distribution of a bit string, a secret key, between two end points. Since quantum cannot be cloned or split, it can be used for providing fool proof mechanism for secure and efficient key management. This paper proposes a novel key management framework with underlying customized protocols to form a quantum trusted network that serve e-Governance applications in India. The custom protocols help to overcome the point-to-point limitation of quantum besides curbing security loopholes for reliable and provably secure communications.

"""Integrating OAuth and Aadhaar with e-Health care System""","""Smartphone based E-health applications have the potential to change the way in which information is being exchanged between various stakeholders present in the medical industry by providing quick access to processed medical data on the go. E-health applications have gained wide acceptance among the doctor community because of their ability to help doctors in understanding the various pattern of symptoms that show up in the initial stages of a disease or during a relapse which in turn saves a lot of time and lives. These applications have also been used by a lot of patients to get instant access to their medical history which otherwise would have not have been possible with the traditional way of maintaining printed medical records in a file. Health records of a patient usually contain sensitive information and digitalization of these records will significantly increase the chances of private data falling into the wrong hands so it is very critical to provide secured access mechanisms to all the stakeholders present in this system and ensure users privacy. Medical data breach can be avoided by the implementation of various authentication and authorization techniques wherever necessary. Health care sector doesn't have a centralized way of identifying a patient and this decreases the feasibility of large scale storage and maintenance of the medical records provided by various doctors. Ever since the introduction of Aadhaar in India, all the major organizations have put in immense amount of effort to link various users accounts to their Aadhaar number and this has turned out to be very beneficial because it has reduced the processing time, reduced the leakage in the system and also eradicate the duplicity of account in sectors like LPG Subsidy, Academic Scholarship, Crop Insurance etc. Through this work, approaches involved in design and implementation of an Aadhaar based E Health application with OAuth is discussed.""",,"""A.

In this paper, we describe an architecture of crowdsensing testbed for capturing and processing events affecting citizens in cities in India. One of the design principle of our testbed is that it encourages users to do an open-ended sensing under five broad categories: Civic complaints, traffic, neighbourhood issues, emergency and others. As part of testbed, we allow events submissions from different submission modes i.e. mobile application, SMSes and web. Our mobile application exploits different sensing interfaces provided by today's smartphones to add contextual data with event reports such as images, audio, fine-grained location etc. Proposed testbed is used by university students across India to report event happening around them.

Due to plant diseases, there is a threat to the food security at the global scale and it majorly affects the small and big farmers, whose lives depend on farming. Disease detection is extremely important in agriculture since it might impair productivity if it is not done at the beginning of the farming production. India loses 35% of crop yield due to these types of diseases. This article has proposed the possibility of image processing and machine learning (i.e., computer vision) approaches to develop a scalable and early crop detection. To acquire the best accuracy, this study has also evaluated several images to identify different crop diseases. The dataset used here is plant village. Three basic steps are used in the implementation process, they are image preprocessing, feature extraction and then training the machine learning model. Then finally if a new image which is not there in the dataset is given as input to the model it predicts the disease with best accuracy. These results show the effectiveness of the model. In future, an application will be developed to implement smartphones assisted crop disease detection by showing the disease name, type of the disease, and the measures that need to implement to prevent further occurrence of diseases, which is particularly useful for the farmers to take good decisions that lead to the healthy growth of the crop.""",,"""T.

Threat sensitivity is measured by calculating threat sensitivity scores for seventy four different IS&P threats in fourteen functional areas [13]. Using convenient sampling, a response set of 1280 was collected from the students of six higher education institutions in India, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan and Thailand. Dimensions of internet use are computed and their correlations are calculated with student's overall threat sensitivity. Only type of use is found significantly correlated with overall threat sensitivity. Application of ANalysis Of VAriance (ANOVA) shows that students are significantly different in overall threat sensitivity, if divided into groups based upon the type of internet use. Further, the relationship between dimensions of internet use and student's threat sensitivity within all fourteen functional areas was also examined.""",,"""A. Farooq; L. Balakrishnan; M. Phadung; S.

"""Cyber Emergency Response Team for Bangladesh""","""Cyber Emergency Response Team (CERT) is one of the very important component at the national level for the protection and monitoring of cyber domain across the country. As the digital contents are increasing in Bangladesh so is its vulnerability. CERT has been included in the National Cyber Security Strategy and Digital Security Act 2018 but its existence is only at the rudimentary stage with the absence of its footprint at the operational level. This study presents a framework of CERT for Bangladesh considering its application at operational level. The factors considered in this model are status of readiness for CERT, the parties involved in the response mechanism and the procedures involved. The proposed model will present an effective CERT in the domain of digitization and information sharing and will guide to a comprehensive approach to address any cyber incident. This would not only help taking effective measures to mitigate the effect of any cyber-attack but also to increase the cyber readiness profile of the nation to detect, prevent or minimize the occurrence of cyber incidents.""",,"""Z.

"""Predictive Analysis of Intelligent Sensing and Cloud‐Based Integrated Water Management System""","""Any smart water management system should include the optimal use of the water by effective quality monitoring, controlling, distribution, and consumption. For a county like India, smart water management is a challenging issue because people consider water can be available forever, but it is not the case. Unlike electricity generation using wind and solar, electricity generated by water is more difficult due to the absence of a metering system, the bill would be the common flat rate for all residents irrespective of the varying amounts of water consumed by each household. This chapter proposes the real‐time measurement of consumption, monitoring of leakages, ability to control the water supply if there is leakage, a completely automated platform for societies, and apartment complexes to set up their billing system. The solution consists of a flow sensor meter installed in the main water inlet pipe to pick up water usage data and communicates through the Wi‐Fi network to iOS and Android‐compatible applications. Two sets of modules Home 1 and Home 2 metering system have been designed and tested. The test results show that the bill generated is 13.33 and 22.133 for flow rate of 17.688 and 26.667, respectively.""",,"""T. Patgar; R.

"""Measuring the Sustainable-Security of Web Applications Through a Fuzzy-Based Integrated Approach of AHP and TOPSIS""","""Ensuring sustainable-security of web applications for minimizing security breaches and enhancing users' trust and satisfaction is the foremost priority of all security experts and web developers. However, sustainable-security is multidimensional, emergent, and an irreducible concept. Also, designing sustainable-security of web application is a complex process because it is a multi-attribute approach which is based on the users' needs and organization's policies. In this context, the decision making process could be an effective means to quantitatively evaluate sustainable-security of web application design. In this research study, the authors have used a technique that involves integrating Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (Fuzzy AHP) and Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (Fuzzy TOPSIS) approaches for the assessment of sustainable-security of web applications. The efficacy of this technique has then been tested on a web application designed specifically to cater to the requisites of an academic institution, Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University in India. Given the sensitivity of web application, this paper has used different versions of a University web application. The results thus obtained and the approach employed in this study would definitely aid the future researchers and developers in designing web applications with higher sustainable-security.""",,"""A.

"""Geo-intelligence based terrain-aware mobile backhaul planning for rural India""","""This paper proposes ITU-T fiber based technology specific mobile backhaul planning for rural India. More than 70% mobile towers of India are installed in rural areas. However, rural India lacks basic infrastructure e.g. connecting roads, electricity and mobile backhaul bandwidth to provide broadband services. In order to take the advantage of growing mobile technologies to address the digital divide of rural India, it is essential to provide adequate backhaul connectivity. Fiber based technologies have merits to address this demand. Technological planning of fiber based technology requires accurate digital mapping of existing, new fiber and components on GIS. The selection of appropriate technology for Cost, Coverage, Capacity, QoS and Security aspects for rural areas are of prime concern. The present research focuses on region specific technology selection with existing infrastructure considering diversity of India e.g. difficult hilly terrain in North East, Himachal, Uttrakhand, deserts in Rajasthan, costal region and ghat areas in Western India. The limited budget and bandwidth requirement of rural India, suggests tree based Passive Optic Network (PON) as the suitable technology. A case study for this approach in hilly, coastal and desert area has been carried out in the presented paper.""",,"""P. K. Dalela; S. Basu; S. Majumdar; A. Yadav; A. Singh; N. Nagpal; V.

"""A Study of Emerging Areas in Adoption of Blockchain Technology and it’s Prospective Challenges in India""","""Blockchain technology is a decentralized distributed system meant for secure computation and information sharing platform free from any central authority that enables multiple authoritative domain which do not trust each other, to cooperate, coordinate and collaborate in rational decision-making process. Bitcoin is pioneer crypto currency platform that uses blockchain technology but over the time it has moved beyond Bitcoin and has successfully bypassed to other application domain. Beside Bitcoin, Ethereum, Hyperledger and Corda, Quorum have emerged as a successful distributive computing platform. Major consortium like Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, Hyperledger and R3 are formed with aim to come up with business solution. Today we have different blockchain application in public sector, finance, supply-chain, healthcare and IoT. In many industries people think blockchain will be transformative. Financial sector is most enthusiastic in adopting blockchain followed by supply chain management. Blockchain is closely looked at in India too. In 2018 Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has issued a white paper in order to identify the potential application areas of blockchain in Indian banking. NITI Aayog is working on national strategy for blockchain which will identify the area where country can implement blockchain. Blockchain is still new and has issues like scalability, security and privacy breaches, limited transaction loads, and high (computational) costs, besides its technical problem, adopting blockchain into Indian market system has its own specific challenges.

"""Encryption Policies of Social Media Apps and Its Effect on User's Privacy""","""The motive behind this research paper is to outline recently introduced social media encryption policies and the impact that they will have on user privacy. With close to no Data Protection Laws in the country, all social media platforms pose a threat to one's privacy. The various new privacy policies that have been put in place across different social media platforms, tend to take away the user's choice on whether they want their data shared with other social media apps or no. Seeing how WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram are all Facebook owned, any data shared across one platform crosses over with the database of another, regardless of whether you have an account or not, completely taking away from the concept of consensual sharing of data. This paper will further discuss how the nature of encryption in India will significantly affect India's newly recognised fundamental right, the Right to Privacy.

"""Digital Inclusion for the Differentaly-abled Farmers""","""In July 2016, the Registrar General of India (RGI) released Census 2011 data on disabled population. Out of 2.68 crore disabled persons in India, 20% have movement disability, followed by persons with seeing and hearing disability, at 19% each. Majority of the disabled population i.e. 63.66% either do not work due to their dependency on others or are not skilled enough to do the work. Only 54.5% are literates, of which only 8.5% had attained graduates or higher levels of education. Lack of the required resources or infrastructure akin to their need, is also a key challenge. Government has launched slew of social security schemes to provide opportunities to People with Disabilities (PwDs), but challenge lies with accessing these benefits. This is especially difficult for the 69% of disabled persons from rural. Spread of mobile phone based digital technology and services have brought more transparency and awareness. Social collaboration applications like facebook, What’sApp have become popular due to forming a close group of the people with similar disability and sharing the information about new schemes and success stories. A few disabled farmers from MP are using local language mobile app mKRISHI® CCA to manage their farms.

"""Crowdsourced Transport Management System for Smartphone Users""","""The population of Dhaka city in Bangladesh is increasing rapidly. The demand for public transport is also increasing with this increasing population. Most of the people use public transport to go to desired places as they are less expensive. In a crowded city, traffic jam, mismanagement of the transport system and some other issues cause the desired transport not to reach the destination in proper time. People had to wait for a long time to get their desired transport. Moreover, there is also a security issue for the people during night time. In this paper, we proposed a framework for public transport management system using crowdsourcing for smartphones. This system will help users to find the nearest public transport like bus, train, etc. to their desired route. In this system, smartphones collect location information using GPS and send it to the system. Users have to provide their source and destination location for searching the available nearby public transports. Then, the system will track the nearby public transport information using mobile crowdsourcing. The users can view the exact position of the transport and reach the stoppage without wasting any time. This system helps the user to reduce their mental pressure and also increase their security. The entire experiment is done using only 300 public transport information for some region of Dhaka city. In future, we will increase the size of our data set. We will implement the system for different smartphones to make the system more user-friendly.""",,"""M. S. Rana; M. J. Hosen; A. A. Noman; L.

"""Smart Footsteps Power Generation System""","""The demand for electrical energy is expected to rise steadily in near future. Contemporary methods of generating electrical power are harmful to the environment. Footstep power generation is one of the sustainable electric energy generation technique which is environment friendly. India can exploit it’s large population, to generate footstep power to satisfy the growing demand for electricity. This paper has proposed a smart footstep power generation system which apart from generating and storing electric energy, provides the facility of remote monitoring and controlling. ANN is used to detect the sensor location which is faulty. The system is able to charge a 12V lead battery completely within 10 minutes using a single person (weighing 45 kg) footstep. This battery then further drives two loads – a DC fan and LED for approximately 30 minutes. Charging voltage can be easily scaled up by increasing the number of piezoelectric sensors. An Android mobile app has been developed to monitor and control the system remotely. The ANN is able to detect location of the faulty sensor with 74% accuracy. At the outset, developing a sustainable electricity generating system with smart capabilities is a substantial contribution of this paper.""",,"""S. M. Pandit; N. Salunke; T. Chettiar; P.

"""Memhans: an Assistive Device for Dementia Patients""","""Worldwide, around 50 million people have dementia with symptoms including loss of memory, difficulty in thinking ability, issues with problem-solving and usage of language. About 1.2 million people provide specialised care for dementia patients throughout the world, but the number of trained dementia caretakers are low in India. Traditionally, the focus of medical research has been to find a plausible cure for dementia, while solutions to ease the lives of dementia patients, their caretakers, and their families are often neglected. This paper aims to design and develop a bio-engineering based assistive device- Memhans for patients suffering from the mild and moderate stage of dementia through the help of a case study, intensive design methodologies and prototyping skills. The prototype is an RFID based module integrating a GPS chip (for location tracking) with Bluetooth and a smartwatch app which has the function of relaxing the patient with music. It also provides notifications to the patient, their family, and their caretaker via respective smartphone apps and provides for a contextual understanding by `object and person identification'. This device provides the patient with assistance in daily activities, safety, person and object identification, and most importantly helps them live a dignified life. It also gives a sense of security and eases the minds of the caretaker and the patient's family. This device is cost-effective and is developed for a large number of impoverished patients who reside in developing countries like India.""",,"""U. Sait; V. D. Ravishankar; T. Kumar; S.

"""A Review on IoT-based Defensive Devices for Women Security""","""In India, the number of crimes committed against women and girls is rising quickly every day. Even in our developed environment, women are unable to live autonomously. Domestic violence, assaults, threats, and teasing of women and girls are recorded often each day. Women are worshipped as goddesses in India. Women play many roles like mother, sister, and spouse and guide men in many aspects. But they are underrated and face unexpected assaults, domestic violence, and threats from society. One female in India is physically assaulted every 1 hour, as per the latest official data. But owing to a lack of sufficient proof, the offender escapes punishment. Such incidents are 99% unidentified, undetected, and undocumented. Surveillance cameras are somewhat helpful, but when the incident takes place in a secluded place, it is impossible to track down the suspect. One of the key causes is that school children are not taught the distinction between pleasant and unpleasant touch. Girls who are aware of the unpleasant touch but don't want to tell their parents tend to do so reluctantly or wait until after the crime has been done, which is useless. In such circumstances, the chance of the offender being punished is relatively minimal. Many researchers have suggested, designed, and implemented Women's Safety Devices (WSD) which protect them from unexpected abuses, assaults, teasing, and threats. There are many WSDs implemented by many researchers in this modern world using the Internet of Things (IoT), Embedded Systems, and Mobile apps. In this work, we studied the existing methods related to Embedded and IOT-based WSD that worked effectively and efficiently and presented challenges that most of the researchers faced while developing WSD. We hope these challenges and research gaps may be useful for building new, efficient, flawless, and accurate WSD by the existing and young researchers who are working in the domain of WSD.""",,"""K.

"""Utilization of solar and biomass for rural electrification in Bangladesh""","""Electricity is a far-way dream for many families in developing countries rural area like Bangladesh. In Bangladesh nearly 75% of the population lives in rural areas and access to electricity in rural areas is only 22% Ensuring improved electricity supply is essential for socio-economic development and environmental sustainability. It has a direct influence on the life situation of the rural poor, affecting their productivity, health, education, and gender-related issues. The government of Bangladesh has a noble vision to provide electricity for all citizens by the year 2021. Suitable geographic location and as an agricultural country, Bangladesh is richly endowed with solar and biomass energy. So, solar and biomass energy together with national grid electricity is an appropriate option to meet the electricity requirements of people in rural areas. This paper examines Bangladesh rural area electricity demand and supply security by solar and biomass energy together with national grid electricity from 2010-2030 by using long range energy alternative planning system (LEAP) model. The results show that the total electricity demand of rural area in Bangladesh is about 27 TWh and is easily mitigated by solar and biomass energy together with national grid electricity. Solar and biomass electrification will provide direct and indirect benefits to the users of the system, with many implications of a permanent nature. Reduction of environment polluted kerosene usage is the main impact. A rural family can get bright light, watch TV, uses fan and power their mobile phones by using environment friendly renewable energy.

The organizers of the event have said that the purpose of this hackathon is to provide a platform to those working on it along with discussing the use and possibilities of block chain in India. During this hackathon, the winners will also be awarded up to three lakh rupees. Block chain has been the topic of discussion all over the world in recent times. Ever since the crypto currency era began, block chain has come into the limelight more and more, because crypto currency works on block chain technology itself. As the use of crypto currencies or NFT (Non-Fungible Tokens) is increasing all over the world, the importance of block chain technology is also increasing. Block chain technology is now starting to have its impact on the life of the common man. Many of the services we use in our daily lives may be based on block chain technology, but we are not aware of it. In this way, in today's time, it is important to know about what block chain is and how our lives are connected to it.""",,"""T. Kaur; S. Bagchi; S. K. Debnath; J.

"""A Knowledge-Based Integrated System of Hesitant Fuzzy Set, AHP and TOPSIS for Evaluating Security-Durability of Web Applications""","""There has been a phenomenal increase in the use of web applications in every facet of human endeavor. From education, healthcare, banking, business to governance and so much more now depends on secure web applications. This accelerated growth in the use of web applications has led to increase in the complexity of security and hence the present day developers have to contribute more significantly towards meeting the users' requirements. However, the high security of web application is not yet efficacious enough because the durability of web application is not as much as it should be. In this context, it is important to consider that ensuring sustainability of security at the early stage of web application development process may reduce costs and rework entailed during the development of secure and durable web applications. Hence, there is a need to focus on increasing the life-span of a secure web application. Quantitative estimation of security-durability plays a significant role for improving the life-span of a secure web application. Thus, to optimize the security assurance effort for a specific life-span, this paper is aimed at estimating the security-durability of web application. For estimating security-durability, this paper uses a hybrid approach of Hesitant Fuzzy (HF) sets, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) techniques. The effectiveness of the combined approach of HF-AHP-TOPSIS is tested for its accuracy in a web application for an academic institution, Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University in India. To check the sensitivity of outcomes, authors of the paper have taken altered forms of the University's web application. The result established contains the security-durability assessment. This work seeks to be an important contribution in enhancing the security-durability and would be beneficial for experts who are working in this domain.""",,"""R. Kumar; A. I. Khan; Y. B.

"""Crop Prediction using Machine Learning""","""In general, agriculture is the backbone of India and also plays an important role in Indian economy by providing a certain percentage of domestic product to ensure the food security. But now-a-days, food production and prediction is getting depleted due to unnatural climatic changes, which will adversely affect the economy of farmers by getting a poor yield and also help the farmers to remain less familiar in forecasting the future crops. This research work helps the beginner farmer in such a way to guide them for sowing the reasonable crops by deploying machine learning, one of the advanced technologies in crop prediction. Naive Bayes, a supervised learning algorithm puts forth in the way to achieve it. The seed data of the crops are collected here, with the appropriate parameters like temperature, humidity and moisture content, which helps the crops to achieve a successful growth. In addition as the software, a mobile application for Android is being developed.

"""The Personal Stun-A Smart Device For Women's Safety""","""Women security is need of the hour now-a-days. In India, there are many cases of women harassment and molestation. Safety of women matters let be whether at home, outdoor or it be their work place. The literature surveyed shows that there are many mobile applications that are used for women safety purpose. One recent research study shows that there is a footwear chip which is sticked to the footwear that gets activated when the person taps one leg behind the other 4 times. We focus on developing a prototype that is a smart band which gets activated by tapping on the screen twice. Once the device is activated it starts sending the GPS location to the ICE contacts and police control rooms. There is a pulse rate sensor embedded in the device that senses the pulse rate of the person and a temperature senor that senses body temperature of the person. The band when thrown with force the force sensor will get activated and sends the current location of the victim. A Piezo buzzer siren will get activated after 1-2 mins of the actual device getting turned on. The range of the buzzer is of 80-110 dB which can be heard from a distance of 50 feet long. An electric shock circuit is designed that emits electric current. On the top of the band screen there are two metal points that generates the shock when the two metal points come in contact with any surface or anybody. The device supports a micro usb charging. A smart application will be developed on the android platform which is connected with the device via bluetooth interface that shows the sensed data of the subject to the ICE contacts. Until the device is turned off it will send the location on the interval of 5 mins and will keep on beeping continuously.""",,"""S. Ahir; S. Kapadia; J. Chauhan; N.

"""Investigation of Signal Penetration Loss Variation on Different Building Components and Disparity of Receiver Location on 3G/4G Network in the Context of Bangladesh""","""In most cases, the cellphone signal level is found weak inside a building than outside due to signal dropping caused by penetration. Because of penetration loss, the indoor cellular network signal shows poor performance, and imperfect reception occurs. Penetration loss is influenced by the building material types used in construction, the building structure, and orientation. In this work, the penetration loss was measured subject to construction materials and different network bands, i.e. UMTS and LTE on 3G and 4G network. The measurements were taken from a multi-storied building and a multi-storied mud house located in a rural area in Chattogram district of Bangladesh. This work was done in respect of Bangladesh, where most of the areas are rural; therefore, the rural area was taken as standard. Android mobile with an installed application named ""Network Signal Info"" and LTE/4G/3G network supported SIM of a primary cellular network service provider in Bangladesh named 'Robi Axiata' was used to measure the data. Penetration loss fluctuation on the variation of the receiver height (floor to floor) and the Base station (BS)-Rx distance (room to room) was accounted as evaluation metrics to measure and study the signal strength performance. It is observed from the resultant data that; the increment of receiver height reduces the penetration loss where the increment of BS-Rx distance exacerbates this loss. By comparison, it is also found that penetration loss is always higher in 4G networks than 3G network band from all aspects. Besides, the mud constructed house gives higher penetration loss compared to the brick constructed building for each parameter.""",,"""M. M. Soliman; M. Maruful Hasan Sabbir; M. Alkaeed; M. R.

"""Multibiometric Cryptosystems Based on Feature-Level Fusion""","""Multibiometric systems are being increasingly de- ployed in many large-scale biometric applications (e.g., FBI-IAFIS, UIDAI system in India) because they have several advantages such as lower error rates and larger population coverage compared to unibiometric systems. However, multibiometric systems require storage of multiple biometric templates (e.g., fingerprint, iris, and face) for each user, which results in increased risk to user privacy and system security. One method to protect individual templates is to store only the secure sketch generated from the corresponding template using a biometric cryptosystem. This requires storage of multiple sketches. In this paper, we propose a feature-level fusion framework to simultaneously protect multiple templates of a user as a single secure sketch. Our main contributions include: (1) practical implementation of the proposed feature-level fusion framework using two well-known biometric cryptosystems, namery,fuzzy vault and fuzzy commitment, and (2) detailed analysis of the trade-off between matching accuracy and security in the proposed multibiometric cryptosystems based on two different databases (one real and one virtual multimodal database), each containing the three most popular biometric modalities, namely, fingerprint, iris, and face. Experimental results show that both the multibiometric cryptosystems proposed here have higher security and matching performance compared to their unibiometric counterparts.""",,"""A. Nagar; K.

"""PAW Patrol: IoT based Smart Wearable Device for Protection Against Violence on Pedophile, Alzheimer’s, Women""","""Women are considered goddesses in India and they are given a respected place in society. But, in present days women are facing many challenges not only women but also for children. The act of Pedophiles (Person who is sexually attracted to children) is increasing day by day. There were many attacks on the women and children when they are alone. One major issue is missing elder persons who are suffering from Alzheimer’s. Recently in 2021, India recorded 31000 cases of crimes against women. Every year this count is increasing rapidly. There are many challenges faced by our system, as recently a 14-year-old girl committed suicide in Vijayawada due to political pressure, In Rajasthan, a 15-year girl was group raped by 16 men for nine days. One aspect of getting these incidents is the lack of immediate response. So, this research work has decided to implement a solution to this type of problem. There are many existing applications associated with a mobile phone. But remember, it is not possible to unlock the mobile phone and call the police all the time. This research work came up with the new idea of developing a smart wearable watch that acts as a location tracker. When women or children who are suffering from Alzheimer’s are in a tough situation, they just need to press the button provided on a smartwatch, then the location of that smartwatch will be sent to their family member’s mobile number. So that they can reach out to the place quickly. No one can find out this as a location tracker, as it looks like a real watch. Our proposed system will help to reduce these types of incidents by sending an immediate response to their family members. GPS technology is used to trace the location and Twilio is an API that helps to send S MS to the family member’s mobile phone. This is a small-sized, low-cost, simple-to-use smartwatch. So that even children can use it.""",,"""N. V. K; R. Ch; V. U. K. P; L. Ch""",2022,10.1109/ICICCS53718.2022.9788333,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9788333,IEEE Conferences

"""Processing and modelling of short–offset seismic refraction—coincident deep seismic reflection data sets in sedimentary basins: an approach for exploring the underlying deep crustal structures""","""We present a new approach to extract deep crustal velocity structure from short-offset seismic refraction sections acquired over sedimentary basins. A coincident deep seismic near-vertical (NV) reflection stack section is used to constrain the derived crustal structure. The high-amplitude free-surface multiples, often found on refraction sections due to high velocity gradients in shallow sedimentary layers, are routinely modelled for velocity and Q structure of the sedimentary strata. These multiples almost completely mask most of the arrivals, including reflected phases from crustal interfaces. By application of velocity filtering with a rejection band that includes the apparent velocity of the free-surface multiples, they can, however, be significantly attenuated. The relatively weak signals, notably the deep crustal reflections in the subcritical (SC) range, can thus be well developed. This approach is demonstrated here by application to a short-offset refraction section in two steps: initially, the free-surface multiples are modelled for obtaining the sedimentary basin velocity structure, later they are substantially attenuated by velocity filtering to enhance the weak SC reflections, further modelled for the velocity structure of the deep crust underlying the west Bengal sedimentary basin, India. The stack section obtained by processing the deep seismic NV reflection data set, coincident with the short-offset refraction section, is consistent with and well substantiates the derived model of the crustal velocity structure in the region.""",,"""V.

"""We've Looked at Clouds from Both Sides Now""","""Cloud Computing is a versatile technology that can support a broad-spectrum of applications. The low cost of cloud computing and its dynamic scaling renders it an innovation driver for small companies, particularly in the developing world. Cloud deployed enterprise resource planning (ERP), supply chain management applications (SCM), customer relationship management (CRM) applications, medical applications and mobile applications have potential to reach millions of users. Cloud deployed applications that employ mobile devices as end-points are particularly exciting due to the high penetration of mobile devices in countries like China, South Africa and India. With the opportunities in cloud computing being greater than at any other time in history, we had to pause and reflect on our own experiences with cloud computing - both as producers and consumers of that technology. Our interests and attitudes toward cloud technology differ considerably for each side of the cloud-computing topic. As producers of cloud-like infrastructure, much of our interest was on the technology itself. We experimented with algorithms for managing remote program invocation, fault tolerance, dynamic load balancing, proactive resource management and meaningful distributed application monitoring. As consumers of cloud computing however, our focus switched from interesting technology to usability, simplicity, reliability and guaranteed rock solid data stability. With an eye to the many cloud articles in the recent news, we have to ask, is cloud computing ready for prime time? After reviewing stories about current cloud deployments, we conclude that cloud computing is not yet ready for general use, many significant cloud service failures have been reported and several important issues remain unaddressed. Furthermore, besides the failures and gaps in the current cloud offerings, there is an inherent flaw in the model itself. Today, the cloud represents an opportunity for a client to outsource hardware/software function or program computing cycles. The missing piece is responsibility outsourcing - today something found only in IT Outsourcing contracts. This missing piece represents an essential component of a cloud offering. Without it, cloud consumers are left without any real reassurances that their data is safe from failures, catastrophe or court ordered search and seizure. In this paper, we explore the different viewpoints of cloud computing. Leveraging our experiences on both sides of clouds, we examine clouds from a technology aspect, a service aspect and a responsibility aspect. We highlight some of the opportunities in cloud computing, underlining the importance of clouds and showing why that technology must succeed. Finally, we propose some usability changes for cloud computing that we feel are needed to make clouds ready for prime time.""",,"""T. J. Lehman; S.

The increasing trend is seen both in the duration and frequency of monsoon-breaks over the subcontinent, the causes for which are investigated using in situ, satellite, and reanalysis data products. While noting that the increasing trend of break-monsoon conditions is consistently related to changes in large-scale monsoon circulation and vertically integrated moisture transport; the findings also point to the role of sea surface temperature (SST) warming trend (0.015 degC middotyear-1) in the tropical eastern Indian Ocean (IO) in inducing anomalous changes favorable for the increased propensity of monsoon-breaks. The results indicate that the SST warming in the tropical eastern IO has altered the ocean-atmosphere processes in a manner as to intensify the near-equatorial trough over the IO, but has led to a weakening of the southwest summer monsoon flow in recent decades into the Indian landmass.""",,"""M.

"""Stand Alone Distribution Feeder Inter Area fault Location Identification System for Indian Utility""","""India is a developing country and the major power behind developing the country is its incredible power handling as well as dispensing capability. The number of utility consumers per unit area is increasing day by day which in turn leads to transmission system complexity. Also, the distance which each feeder should be fed is exponentially becoming lengthier/loaded compare to that of year's back. Such a system is expected to experience various faults at any time and therefore Smart Systems should be developed/incorporated in order to manage such complex systems. The work presented here looks into the inter-area fault location which exactly locates the fault origin area. As mentioned earlier, the distribution side is comparatively much longer with added complexities; the identification of fault location is difficult for the lineman during fault cases. The different faults which occur in a transmission system are line to ground fault (L-G) line to line fault (L-L) line-line-line to ground fault (L-L-L-G) and leakage fault. In such cases, the lineman has to inspect the particular feeder from one end to the other for identifying the fault which is a tedious job in all sense. Here we propose the new system to identify the exact location of the fault i.e., by using co-ordinate operation of an adaptive sensor and relays. A communication controller platform is designed to detect and communicate the contingency cases and then report it immediately to local remote station. An adaptive voltage sensor is installed at feeders and is coordinated well to obtain the line parameters during contingencies. This data is fed to a micro controller which processes the data and if a fault occurs the exact location of the fault will be sent to an Android Operating System. From the system, by using an Android Application, precise fault location is displayed. This can also be used as a future data collection method for load variation, power factor variations etc. in a transmission system.""",,"""P. Thomas; A. G. Reji; A. Mathew; D.

Similarly other developed countries are also formulating EMC standards for regulation of products in their country. In India, though there is no regulation on EMC compliance, STQC (standardisation, testing and quality certification) directorate formulated a ""EMC Compliance Certification Scheme"" to enable Indian manufacturers to meet various IS, EN, FCC, IEC EMC standards requirements.

"""Plant Disease Detector""","""nowadays agriculture crops face many problems like traits or diseases. Each year plant diseases, viruses and fungal attacks lead to crop losses up to 30% of total production. Clearly control of plant disease depends on accurate and rapid detection and identification of the disease. Detection is the process of identifying the presence of symptoms of disease. Farmers in India have minimal access to agricultural experts, who can inspect crop for identifying disease and provide advice about disease. Delayed expert responses or advice to queries often reach farmers too late which are useless. Automatic detection of plant disease is important as it beneficial to monitor large field of crops and identifies the presence of disease symptom on the plant leaf or stem. In this project we develop Mobile app for automatically detecting plant disease through image processing technique with the objective of providing fast, accurate, ease of use and inexpensive solutions to farmers.""",,"""J.

"""Smart LCC Device: LCC-Based IoT Device for measuring urea consumption in major food crops""","""Lands of Bangladesh are very fertile. Despite having so many fertile lands, Bangladesh cannot gain its expected output of crops. One of the main reasons is Bangladeshi Farmers are unaware of modern technology of crop cultivation. They apply urea in agricultural land according to assumption and do not know the negative impact of excessive urea application which causes the increment of diseases, attack of insects in crops, leads to huge economic loss and environmental pollution by Green House Gas emission and waste of time, money, fertilizer and crops. Leaf Color Chart (LCC) is an example of modern technology, which is a Nitrogen Parameter used to detect either the soil of green crops like Paddy, Wheat and Maize requires Urea Fertilizer or not and if it requires then, how much Urea is needed to be applied. But it requires many calculation processes and the whole processes are different for different crops which seems difficult for farmers to memorize and calculate. This paper attempts an assessment in proposing the solution and at the same time develops a prototype of a device with IoT features for the use of the farmers on Bangladeshi Agricultural Land to get rid of this problem. Farmers only need to input Crop, the Land Size and match certain numbers of Leaves Color prescribed by the Device with given 6 green color strips of the color chart on the Device and The Device then shows and tells either the land requires Urea or not and if it requires then how much Urea is needed to be applied. Internet of Things (IoT) is implemented in the Device so that important data about these Urea measurement process with exact time and location are stored on the Online Database. The stored data can be analyzed by the online website using bar-chart and Google heat-map to help Bangladesh Agriculture Ministry in monitoring country-wide urea applications efficiently.""",,"""M.

"""Farm-Copter: Computer Vision Based Precision Agriculture""","""The agricultural practices in India dates back to the Indus Valley Civilizations and even before that in some parts of southern India. India is considered to be having the second rank worldwide in farm products. Agricultural exports also add to the Indian economy. Those farmers having large plantations face various difficulties during their agricultural routines. These difficulties include identifying the time of harvest of the crops, protecting the crops from pest attacks, preventing the outspread of diseases in crops, determining the moisture content of the soil, etc. The usual measures taken against these problems include the use of pesticides, insecticides, etc., and the use of manual labor for inspecting the growth of the crops and attacks on the crops by rodents. Checking each and every crop manually is practically not possible and is surely a time-consuming process that demands a great amount of manual labor. This project aims to implement a system that makes the above-mentioned tasks easier and more convenient for the farmers. The initial aim of the project is to implement a system using a quadcopter and different image processing techniques that enable us to monitor the crops and provide information regarding the crops thereby reducing the manual labor for the same. A quadcopter fitted with the camera captures the images of the crops, these images are then processed using suitable application software and the information regarding the crops are provided to the farmer to take necessary actions.

"""Status study on sustainability of satellite communication systems under hostile jamming environment""","""Globalization of commerce and interlinking of economics of all the countries in the world have changed the configurations of local/national/regional Communication links. They have now become truly global network centric. Satellite communication links offer flexible data transmission for ground, sea and airborne units. For military, these satellites have enhanced their capabilities with better co-ordination of command and control. Military satellites use more expensive, complex and jam resistant technologies to reduce their vulnerability to jamming. As of now large number of countries including India do not have adequate number of Mil - Satellites. Even advanced countries used the existing Commercial Satellites by leasing the transponders in times of need like in Desert storm, Iraq war, Afgan war etc. Commercial satellites use FDM-FDMA, FDM-TDMA modulations, which are vulnerable to jamming unlike the Mil - Satellites which use spread spectrum, EHF frequencies, multiple beam transmitting and receiving antennas with nulling capabilities against jamming, processing transponders etc. There are number of instances where in the rogue states and terrorists have disrupted communication. This has become a key concern for military and civilian governments. Another area where satellites are increasingly being used are in Personal communication field also known as Mobile Satellite Services. The location of increasing number of Base Stations in the vicinity of domestic dwellings as a part of cellular phone infrastructure, has created scare about the RF safety among health conscious public (through it is not conclusively proved). Mobile Satellite services are now being considered as a Green alternative to cellular phones. The subject for presentation is to assess the vulnerability of these links, considering the satellite parameters like location, distance, frequency, type of modulation, power transmitted/received, antenna size, polarization, figure of merit, C/N Ratio, link margin, bit rate error etc. The present day Anti jamming techniques and the protection of target satellite from anti-satellites will be briefly discussed.

In India the average death rate due to cardiovascular diseases is about 272 per 10,000 population which is greater than global average of 235 per 10,000 population. From the recent survey results, which was released by the Union Ministry of Family and Health Welfare (MoFHW), the Diabetes disease positive ratio is gradually increasing in India. 11.5 percent people were tested positive for Diabetes among urban and rural Indians who are with age 45 and above. Even there is availability of wide range of treatment methods of heart stroke patients & diabetes, Heart attack with Diabetes is the major cause of death in all parts of rural and urban areas of entire India. There are several factors causing heart and diabetes problems which include Age, Gender, Blood Pressure, Glucose levels, Skin thickness and Insulin. These are easily measured in primary care facility centres. The accurate estimation and analysis of heart & diabetes disease patients reports data may help in predicting future heart problems including diabetes. Globally, the application of computerized machine learning methods to predict future problems is in trend now. The Health Monitoring Departments and Fields uses machine learning algorithms to predict and analyse in a wider way to solve problems in fraction of seconds. From the famous proverb “Prevention is Better Than Cure”, if we apply this to medico and health field we can save people from major Heart Diseases (HD's) along with Diabetes. The proposed Dual disease prediction technique is user interactive based method. The proposed method observe inputs from the end user with realistic data to predict heart and diabetes disease.

Due to some common mistakes that are attempted by some non-professional and under-aged drivers, many other people lose their lives or get severe injuries on the road. It has been a challenging problem for the traffic as well as RTO (Regional Transport Office) to control the number of accidents that happen every year. A high-Security Registration Plate (HSRP) detector is a device that scans and detects the number plate of vehicles. In 2007 Government of India passed an act in which it became mandatory for everyone to install HSRP plates on vehicles but it was not implemented by all the states of India. With an increase in the installation of high-security registration plates, it becomes an easy task for the traffic department to issue fines against the drivers who violate the traffic rules on the roads. This project will detect all the images of HSRP installed vehicles and will convert these images into grayscale images then according to the violation committed; the fine will be displayed on the registered mobile number of the owner.

The key factors required for a farmer to do agriculture are land and the cattle. But nowadays there are many incidents of land attacks and animal theft happening. Recently in the states of Haryana and Delhi there are buffalo thefts happening, which is becoming a nightmare for the farmers. This situation leads them to end up their life or remain starving for their day-to-day needs. Only if the farmers live, people can live; keeping this in mind and as an act of lending a hand for their support, a solution which might stop these types of cruelties taking place on farm lands and making farmers sleep peacefully has been proposed. Through this device the farmer will be receiving an alert on the application installed in their mobile when someone intrudes into his/her farm. On receiving the alert, which will enable the farmer to go to his farm and check if any strange movement is happening. There will be also an alarm installed in the farmer’s land which will alert the neighboring localities/farmers. Through this any type of intrusion into his/her farm can be prevented.

The safety of the students within the VTU campus begins with the surveillance of the campus that requires All-time monitoring of the vast area. A four wheeled automated movement-based robot with a path tracking capability provides us the freedom of monitoring the robot, The surveillance aspect is derived through the use of ESP cam 32 that gives continuous monitoring of the campus. The security aspect is dealt with the restricted accessibility and admissibility to various building blocks using RFID technology and connecting all these buildings through internet and store all these data in a freely accessible Google spreadsheet which provide precisive time-based monitoring of entry and exit to and from the respective blocks. The advancement of technology allows us to apply Internet of Things based applications for the surveillance and security of the campus by supervising from any remote location to identify any intruders into the campus or any fraudulent activities within the campus. The application of IOT is used to create a web of integrated accessibility systems that manages the student data by allowing the rightful students and avoiding entry of an outsider to any building blocks of the university. This creates a spreadsheet of entrants which could be used as evidence-based insight about the student’s movement.

The proposed research work aims to overcome this drawback and achieve user identification and authentication through an automated method using the Aadhar card. Aadhar project is developed by the Unique Identification Authority of India by merging biometrics and digitization. The details are stored in the form of a quick response code along with a 12-digit Aadhar card number. A model is built to capture the information from the Aadhar card. The mobile phones are used to obtain the data from the Aadhar card. The user validation is through two-step process using One Time Password and email address. The wireless public key infrastructure issues a digital certificate to the valid user. The proposed authentication and symmetric key exchange algorithm are formally verified and analyzed using automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications. The result of simulation proves that the proposed scheme is secure and safe. The experimental results show that time consumption for user authentication is acceptable. The acceptance of the proposed automated user identification and authentication model is authorized using a modified technology acceptance model. The result proves that there exists a strong relationship between the perceived usefulness of items and the Attribute Of Use (AOU). It also exhibits that the association between the AOU and user satisfaction is influential. The model demonstrates that the association between the Perceived Ease Of Use and attribute towards use is weak.

"""Security vulnerabilities in open source projects: An India perspective""","""Educational and governmental organizations are heavy users of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) due to the numerous economic advantages it offers. But because of the lack of formal notification of vulnerabilities in them these users are left with exploitable risks in their systems with known vulnerabilities which could completely offset the economic gains and lead to unrecoverable losses. India is one of the largest consumers of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) though in the last few years there has been concerted effort to contribute to the movement as well as create its own FOSS to support local languages. This paper compares and analyses the public disclosure of vulnerabilities in Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) to those of non-open source systems. Our case study with (N=218) Information Technology (IT) professionals working in computer systems, networks and application development areas indicates an urgent need to enhance vulnerability handling practices for Free and Open Source Software based applications.

"""RFID based secure voting system with biometric authentication""","""The voting system around the world has been plagued by numerous fundamental flaws, resulting in a corrupt candidate winning an election. For elections in democratic countries like India, the voting mechanism is extremely important. Generally, India's electoral commission has relied on electronic voting machines, which require more staff, take longer to process, and are less reliable. Approaches to addressing the issues with voting methods are required. So, In this project we came up with an idea to eradicate the existing system problem by incorporating various technologies that are being used these days especially for confidential purposes. This proposed system explicates a vulnerable part of the existing system to be terminated by proceeding with IOT being the power source for this project, followed by that we have included RFID to be used for authentication along with the biometrics for enhancing our system as a functional, safe and secure system. Being a Multi-tier authentication system, our system is handled by two individuals to start the process of voting. One, with the initialization of IOT and another who commences the casting process with the authentication of RFID.

Currently, farmers use traditional ways of approximations for amount of fertilizer used and the type of crop to be sown. Agriculture extremely depends on the type of soil and climatic condition of the region. Therefore, it becomes vital to create advancement in this field. With the help of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques we will create a Web-App which will be one-stop solutions for information regarding the agriculture. Crop and fertilizer recommendation system will help the farmers in increasing their yield production. We are going to take the soil parameters along with the weathers API to figure out the most suitable crop for that region. Using the decision tree and navies bayes algorithm we will make the recommendation model which will use the N-K-P, Ph. value and rainfall as the parameters for training. Basis on the crop and region of farming we will recommend the fertilizer and its uses to boost the yield productivity for farmers. Sometimes due to unwanted excess of rainfall or the pest attack can cause disease to crops. We will use the image classification technique where the user can upload the picture of the affected plant/crop and the system will figure out the type of disease which will be done using Support Vector Machine (SVM) or using the neural network techniques. And this disease detection will suggest that how that plant/crop can be cure or prevent. The aim is to make a common system for all the features and provide the results with the best accuracy for all the crops over most of the regions all over the India.

"""Buddy Scanner – A Scanning Application""","""Amidst the tense Indo-China border conditions in North-east India coupled with the `Atmanirbhar Bharat' initiative, the IT ministry of India had banned 59 China-owned applications, including Cam Scanner, Tik Tok, ShareIt, etc., and thus were also taken down from the Indian Playstore for sovereignty and security. Among the banned 59 applications, CamScanner had been an integral part of daily documentation which allowed users from organizational, governmental, commercial, and academic backgrounds to convert the camera-clicked images of important documents into scanned PDF format. But after the ban of CamScanner, users faced a lot of inconveniences to create these despite the introduction of other alternative Indian scanning applications as these applications were less satisfactory in comparison to CamScanner. Hence to overcome the limitations posed by these alternatives, the application - Buddy Scanner has been proposed, which will use Canny Edge Detection, 4 Point Perspective Transformation to detect the documents edges and provide a good quality transformed image as the output. The Canny Edge Detection increases the accuracy of boundary extraction which will be helpful for detecting the document borders effectively combined with the 4 Point Perspective Transformation to give a well plane aligned image. In addition to this, the application features additional but important functionalities like Optical Character Recognition on images, various options to apply filters and Signature insertion in the images.

"""Mobile position estimation with RSS Based techniques in an urban city with multiple multi-storied structures""","""Accurate position estimation is the vital issue in Location Based Services (LBS) of 3G communications. The quality of LBS depends on the positioning technologies used and the network topology. In this paper, the performance of four prominent self-position fixing methods namely i) RSS Statistics, ii) Least squares (LS) iii) Weighted LS (WLS) and iv) Constrained WLS (CWLS) are compared. The estimations are based on RSS measurements from surrounding base stations (BS) in GSM network. In statistics of Received Signal Strength (RSS) method, 2-D location of MS is estimated based on PDF of propagation distances derived from RSS data using Minimum Mean Square Error criterion. In LS estimation techniques, correlation that exists between propagation distances and RSS measurements is exploited. The performance of WLS method is better than LS method with the inclusion of weight matrix. In CWLS, Lagrangian multiplier is introduced to include the radial distance constraint to improve reliability and integrity of estimates. Experiments are conducted to acquire RSS data by using Test Equipment for Mobile Systems (TEMS) investigation tool and GSM/GPRS 900/1800MHz dual frequency modem for both stationary and kinematic modes of mobile. RSS data acquired in the coverage area of Tirumalgiri BS (17° 28' 11"", 78° 30' 55"", 560m) Hyderabad city, India. BS antenna is at the height of 33m. It transmits power at an effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) of 43 dBm on 950.6 MHz frequency. The acquired field strength values at various points are ranging from -80dBm to -35dBm. For a typical urban GSM cell structure (σshadowing= 6 to 8dB) simulated position estimates are obtained. Experimentally observed results are verified with GPS measurements and found that accuracy is limited by number of hearable BSs involved in the estimation. Comparative error analysis indicates that the accuracy of the location estimation greatly depends on the cell size. Error is least when the BSs involved are well distributed in all the directions around and nearer to the MS which has least Geometric Dilution of Precision (GDOP). It is found that, CWLS method performs well in a densely populated urban city with Multiple Multi-storied structures. Experimental results indicate that CWLS offer less Circular Error Probability (86.7m), RMSE (2.58m), least GDOP (2.0) and error a (1.54m) with 7 BSs. The result will be an important input for designing location assisted handoffs required for reliable mobile links and in deployment of BSs at proper locations to achieve uninterrupted coverage.""",,"""D.

"""Assessment of quasi-permanently vacant channels in mobile communication bands for cognitive radio""","""Basis of cognitive radio is to exploit unused frequency channels in licensed band. Recently standardised IEEE 802.22 set of cognitive radio protocols envisages fixed and nomadic receivers at below 800 MHz bands. Radio link design for this cognitive radio consider that the channels are available only dynamically to secondary users. Scanning period is thus embedded in link layer control as overhead and reduces overall efficiency of cognitive radio technology. For mobile receivers, availability of permanent channels for radio link control is essential for in-band signalling. Existing mobile communication system uses CDMA 800, GSM 900, GSM 1800 and WCDMA 2000 MHz bands for which approximately 1/8th of the band capacity is used for in-band signalling. Present work provides an assessment of vacant channels in mobile communications range which were permanently available at the time of measurement. The study used conventional Radio frequency scanners available for different bands and dedicated engineering handsets for tracking active frequencies. Observations were taken at six different cities of India with population ranging from 1.5 million to 6.6 million. The tests were performed with assemblies carried in a vehicle and across the length and breadth of each city. The allotment of frequencies by Frequency Regulatory Authority to local mobile operators along with the frequency bands reserved for further distribution were also considered. The experimentally collected data were analysed using RF analysis software and spread sheet database. An analysis of the collected data lead to arrive at the conclusion that more than 1/8th part of resources of each band are nearly permanently vacant which is enough to design in-band common control signalling methods for cognitive radio.""",,"""N.

"""Development of national health data warehouse Bangladesh: Privacy issues and a practical solution""","""Healthcare organizations in Bangladesh own a large amount of data in diverse health information systems. Potential and useful hidden knowledge can be discovered if integration of this huge medical data is performed in national level. The integration process requires linkage of patients' records among different heterogeneous sources. To facilitate effective data mining, it is essential to preserve record linkage in health data warehouse by retaining identifiable attributes. On the other hand, identifiable health data have high risk to patient privacy and also increase the chance of attacks by cyber criminals. In this paper, we have provided a practical solution of privacy and security problems for developing national health data warehouse of Bangladesh. Our developed technique can anonymize identifiable private data of the patients while maintaining record linkage in national warehouse to facilitate knowledge discovery process. For this purpose, we have used encrypted mobile number, gender and name-value of patients to produce Patient Identification Key.

"""E-School: A web-service oriented resource based e-learning system""","""The education systems of 21st century are characterized by increasing dependence on various modes of electronic facilities. E-learning is one such facility that can ensure education for everyone without considering their geographical locations. However, due to very high initial cost for infrastructural development, developing countries like Bangladesh are unable to get the total benefits of e-learning. Therefore, the education facilities and standards in rural and remote areas are noticeably dissatisfactory, compared to the urban areas of those countries. Reusing of existing resources and infrastructures to implement an e-learning system can reduce the overall operational cost of the system, hence can be ideal for developing countries to exploit various e-learning facilities. Considering these issues, in this paper we propose to design a web service oriented resource based system named “E-School” for the primary, secondary, and higher secondary education system of Bangladesh. This e-learning system will provide identical course materials, useful multimedia tools, integrated databases, and help desk for students. We design E-School as a platform independent system so that it can be accessed using any cell phone, PDA and computer from anywhere with mobile network coverage.""",,"""A. Sultana; I.

"""Social media users privacy protection from social surveillance using Blockchain Technology""","""Due to rapid technology improvements, an increasing number of people are being connected to the digital world. Considering other parts of life, the internet has grown increasingly vital to Indians. More than 4.39 billion people use the internet, and almost 70% of them use social media on smartphones, tablets, laptops, and other computers. Management, staff, and users all play an important role in information security. As a result, the human has become the weakest point in the digital environment. Human understanding and behavior are essential for successful and efficient usage of technology. The human aspect can be divided into two categories: one in which humans are directly involved in the system in some way, and the other in which they are not. The end users' lack of understanding, belief, conduct, and inappropriate use of technology are the other specific variables. Users desire security, flexibility, and simplicity of use all at the same time. Finding a balance between all these criteria is extremely difficult for any business or service provider. Users must be willing to give all information, including personal and sensitive information, in order to be online. The future is expected to be data-centric and data-driven. Data, according to researchers, is the new fuel that will drive technology forward. As a result, service providers have become accustomed to organizing the data for computational and surveillance purposes. It is time for data to be protected and confidentiality to be respected. The most significant aspect of this issue is the user's concern in deciding whether to share the data. If exchanging data is required, should the customer be able to track who has accessed the data? After that, the user should have a say in who gets access to the information and who does not. So, these are the numerous issues that require research and the development of a robust solution that places data control in the hands of the user. One of the regulations that deals with data protection and user privacy is the GDPR. This regulation must be made mandatory in all countries, including India. Using blockchain technology, the authors discuss various approaches for protecting user privacy and controlling data access.

The structural, morphological, FTIR, DLS, zeta potential characterization studies were performed to optimize the sensing mechanism. First time reporting facile enzyme-free sensor for the detection of L-lactate content in milk. Initially, the sensor has been optimized for nano reagent concentration, pH and time. 3-APBA@AuNPs showed a stable SPR intensity and forms a reversible tetrahedral ester complex with the analyte L-lactate (100 mM) resulting the NPs aggregation and revealing the blue shift of UV-VIS absorption wavelength (λ = 300 nm to 288 nm). Nestle- Lactogen, an India commercial milk powder has been used for the standardization study of lactate sensing. The milk samples spiked with L-Lactate (1-20mM) showed an increase in UV-VIS absorption peak intensity with concentration, and estimated the lower detection limit (LOD) = 1.1 mM using the calibration graphs. The optical sensing mechanism is explained may be due to π-π* transition of AuNPs stabilized by tetragonal complex of L-lactate bonded to 3-boronate via nucleophilic attack on boron atom. The nanosensor data was validated with commercial Megazyme kit and conventional HPLC technique. In commercial product Amul-India milk, the L-lactate value estimated as 0.678Mm with 95% correlation.

Moreover, World Health organization reported, in Bangladesh, about 17% of deaths are caused by cardiovascular diseases. Continual health monitoring and rapid detection can save up to 60% of lives. For these reasons, a wireless, wearable, low cost and automatic health monitoring system is a suitable solution. The implemented project described in this paper is a user- friendly, wearable and continuous monitoring system of blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature, which can communicate with requested Android devices through Bluetooth. The system mainly consists of IR transmitter, receiver, LM-35, MPXV 5050GP, the data acquisition unit, microcontroller (i.e., Arduino) and Bluetooth. Bluetooth is used for its better transmission rate than ZigBee and cost-efficiency than GSM. In addition, all the measured readings and communications are password protected. A free and user- friendly Android application is attributed to demonstrate the readings. The proposed system has been field tested to ensure dependability and exactitude. The test results showed that this system could measure the patient`s physiological data with high accuracy.

Foot biometric has both the physiological and behavioral characteristics still it is an abandoned field. The reason behind this is, it involves removal of shoes and socks while capturing the image and also dirty feet makes the image noisy. Cracked heels is also a reason behind noisy images. Physiological and behavioral biometric characteristics makes it a great alternative to computational intensive algorithms like fingerprint, palm print, retina or iris scan [1] and face. On one hand foot biometric has minutia features which is considered totally unique. The uniqueness of minutiae feature is already tested in fingerprint analysis [2]. On the other hand it has geometric features like hand geometry which also give satisfactory results in recognition. We can easily apply foot biometrics at those places where people inherently remove their shoes, like at holy places such as temples and mosque people remove their shoes before entering from the perspective of faith, and also remove shoes at famous monuments such as The Taj Mahal, India from the perspective of cleanliness and preservation. Usually these are the places with a strong foot fall and high risk security due to chaotic crowd. Most of the robbery, theft, terrorist attacks, are happening at these places.

The researchers have detailed the various possible benefits and risks of this decision based on the limited information provided by the government on the design of the central bank digital currency (CBDC). In particular, they have discussed the cybersecurity risks, such as hacking and government surveillance, and have suggested possible cryptography solutions like hashing and tokenization. The decision also means expanding the role of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) from being just a central bank to providing payment services. The most important design characteristic of the Digital Rupee is its levy of interest. The paper discusses the cases of interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing Digital Rupee, along with their potential economic and monetary policy implications. The researchers have showcased various existing mathematical/ FinTech models for predicting the impact of CBDCs on the banking sector. They have commented that the short-term possibility of replacing cash with the Digital Rupee is non-existent due to the enormous volume of cash transactions in the Indian economy, whereas the long-term probability is much brighter.

Weaker economy and absence of adequate infrastructure facilities are main obstacles of effective e-learning practices in least developed countries. As a member of least developed countries, Bangladesh has lots of challenges regarding e-learning. This study illustrates technological, psychological, socio-cultural and economic factors that would affect successful implementation of e-learning for higher education in Bangladesh. Unwillingness to change the learning atmosphere, poor level of competency in English, lack of funds and technical resources in universities, lack of confidence to practice computer applications coupled with absence of infrastructure such as electricity and telephone lines in many parts of the country are the most difficult issues to address. A five point scale to measure computer knowledge level and another five point scale to measure the e-learning knowledge for least developed countries are used in the study.

"""Analysis of Out-of-Band Interference from UWB Signals to IRNSS Signals""","""IRNSS (Indian Regional Navigation satellite System), an innovation by ISRO has accuracy range of 20 meters in position and provides accurate Navigation. The standard Positioning service offered by IRNSS is an unauthorized service and it is transmitted on L5 and S bands respectively. IRNSS will be one of the most public availed applications and plays vital role in many technological advancements of India. MB-OFDM UWB has its wide applicative expansion in communications as indoor short-range high-speed wireless communication. It is more efficient, provided its high peak to average power ratio (PAPR) problem is optimized and distortions caused by non-linear components like high power amplifier (HPA) are eliminated. The technique used for PAPR reduction, the deliberate clipping causes spectral leakage, which in turn causes interference with other systems outside the frequency bands of UWB. Hence there is intense need to eliminate interference to IRNSS caused due to spectral leakage of UWB. In this paper, the interference to IRNSS signals from MB-OFDM UWB signals is analyzed and effect of filtering after clipping on the spectral leakage is evaluated using power spectral density as performance measure.""",,"""T.

"""Enhancing network lifetime in precision agriculture using Apteen protocol""","""In the recent years Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have garnered attention. The applications of WSN includes collecting, storing and sharing sensed data which is used for habitat monitoring, agriculture, nuclear reactor control, security and tactical surveillance. Here we aim to explore the potential benefits of WSN to address precision agriculture problems in India. Since farming involves a vast area of land to be covered the deployment of sensor nodes includes a few barriers. Sensor nodes are battery powered and improvement of the lifetime of these nodes is important particularly when the nodes collect real time data and assist farmers towards proper cultivation. Here we propose a WSN protocol named APTEEN protocol that helps to increase network lifetime of the nodes by periodic monitoring of the sensor nodes and communicating the necessary parameters to the farmers for taking action. Cultivation of sugarcane crop includes a multi parameter monitoring system designed based on low-power ZigBee wireless communication technology for system automation and monitoring. Real time data is collected by wireless sensor nodes and transmitted to base station using zigbee. Data is received, saved and displayed at base station to achieve soil temperature, soil moisture and humidity monitoring. The data is continuously monitored at base station and if it exceeds the desired limit, a message is sent to farmer on mobile through GSM network for controlling actions. Further the limitations of wired sensor networks are overcome and have the advantage of flexible networking for monitoring equipment, convenient installation and removing of equipment, low cost and reliable nodes and high capacity.""",,"""S.

"""Conception of Geocoding Matching Algorithm for Casablanca City - Morocco""","""A national addressing system is a key component in the Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI), necessary for the countries economic and social development. One of the main technical aspects for establishing a national addressing schema is geocoding methods adapted to the local context. In general, the rules of address identification in Morocco follow the Western model. This might be considered as a positive factor, since geocoding methods and applications are designed according these rules. But, the field analysis shows that the percentage of compliance to these rules remains very modest. In our analysis of the two conditions of `parity” and “respect of address numbers' range” by street section in Casablanca city, we concluded that the percentage of these rules validity is only 53%. When we implemented a geocoding model that takes this fact into consideration, we found that an accuracy of 10m is verified to 55%, while an accuracy of lm is only verified to 17,5%. This means that the validity of geocoding in the Moroccan context is very limited; its use should be targeted and not generalized.""",,"""M. E. I. MALAAININE; H.

"""A Study on the Performance of Delay-Tolerant Network Routing Protocols in the Campus Area of Rajshahi University, Bangladesh""","""Delay-Tolerant Network (DTN) cannot possibly maintain continuous connections among source and destination nodes all the while and exploits mobility of nodes for message propagation. DTN uses store-carry-forward approach where message travels from source to destination node through intermediate nodes by opportunistic contacts due to node movement. These intermediate nodes keep the message in their buffer, carry it while on the move and forward it to the next intermediate node encountered untill the message gets to reach its destination. An important application of DTN is considered to provide for emergency message delivery to key personnel in a disaster-stricken area. The main challenge of DTN is to adopt an appropriate routing technique to deliver messages in the most efficient way. In this work, we look into the performance of DTN routing techniques such as Epidemic, MaxProp, Spray-and-Wait, and Spray-and-Focus by considering the campus area of Rajshahi University as it is one of the key points of importance for higher education and research in Bangladesh. Our goal is to evaluate the performance of DTN routing techniques for emergency message circulation in the campus area of Rajshahi University in case of disaster when regular communication networks are not available. We use the Opportunistic Network Environment (ONE) simulator for the simulation of above situation. The performance of the DTN routing protocols is analyzed based on four criteria: delivery probability, transmission cost, average latency, and average hop count by varying the message size and the density of nodes. From the results obtained from simulation we see that Spray-and-Focus yields the best performance. On the other hand, Epidemic gives the worst performance in the campus area of Rajshahi University, Bangladesh with the given simulation settings""",,"""S. C. Roy; M. A. Islam; M. S.

The SMPS involves high frequency switching operation due to which it generates electromagnetic emissions and has the possibility to interfere with system operation and as a result it can affect the performance of the system. This makes electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) an important concern. To make this system Energy Efficient and Electromagnetic Compliant, the system has been tested for Conducted as well as for Radiated Emission at the Centre for Electronics Test Engineering (CETE), Pune, India which is Government of India undertaking.

"""The Application of Mobile Sensing to Detect CO and NO2 Emission Spikes in Polluted Cities""","""Carbon monoxide (CO) and Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are major air pollutants that have the potential to affect human health adversely. There is a lack of useful information regarding the spatial distribution and temporal variability of CO and NO2 emissions in major metropolitan areas. The primary goal of this research is to provide a geospatial data methodology for detecting emission spikes of CO and NO2 in polluted urban environments employing portable, low-cost sensors. We propose that ephemeral identification of harmful gas concentrations can be achieved using different IoT device types mounted on a mobile platform. We propose that persistent CO and NO2 emission spikes can be identified by driving through the city on different days. We applied this approach to Hyderabad, India, by fixing a mobile platform on a street car. We corrected the IoT device measurement errors by calibrating the sensing component data against a reference instrument co-located on the mobile platform. We identified that random forest regression was the most suitable technique to reduce the variability between the IoT devices due to heterogeneity in the mobile sensing datasets. The spatial variability of CO and NO2 harmful emission spikes at a resolution of 50 m were identified, but their intensity changes on a daily basis according to meteorological conditions. The temporal variability shows a weak correlation between CO and NO2 concentrations. The data from the CO and NO2 emission spikes at Points of Interest that disturb traffic flows clearly show the need for public education about when it is hazardous for persons with respiratory conditions to be outside, as well as when it is unsafe for young children and the elderly to be outside for extended periods of time.

"""Temporal Detection of Pesticide Residues in Tea Leaves Using Hyperspectral Sensing""","""Tea is considered as a healthy beverage due its antioxidant properties and resultant beneficial effects on human health. India is the second largest producer of tea in the world after China, but every year Tea plants are attacked by several pests and diseases that are responsible for 7-10% loss of the crop. Tea growers spray pesticides on the plants for better control on the pests and to reduce crop loss. The uncontrolled usage of pesticide with ineffective management practices results in high residue levels that are hazardous to human health. In this paper, an attempt has been made to detect the pesticide residue on the tea leaves using hyperspectral sensing. The data on leaves treated with three banned chemicals (Acetamiprid, Cypermethrin and Monocrotophos) and control healthy leaves was collected using spectroradiometer in the spectral range of 350-1052 nm in 213 narrow contiguous bands. The spectral observations of the leaf samples (total of 389 samples) in control and treated with each chemical on consecutive days (i.e. from 1 to 7 days) has been collected. The data in 213 narrow contiguous bands is used as feature set for hyperspectral data analysis. The band selection methods are used to overcome collinearity in spectral observations due to contiguous data. Band selection has been performed by 1. Visual Analysis, 2. Principal Component Analysis and 3. Random Forest based feature importance method. The performance of various classifiers such as Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and Linear Discriminant Analysis has been evaluated using different feature sets and classification scenarios. The classification scenarios considered for each pesticide are 1. two class classification with control and pesticide treated samples, 2. three class classification using control samples, 1 and 2 days after pesticide application, 3. four class classification using control samples, 1, 2 and 3 days after pesticide application and 4. eight class classification with control samples and 1-7 days after application. The PCA based feature selection method was found effective among all. The two class classification scenario of control vs treated provided the best classification performance by using the SVM classifier (accuracy of 98.29%) for all the three pesticides (89.04-98.29%). The three class classification results showed that separation of pesticides with one and two days after application is possible with accuracy of 79.81-95.8%.""",,"""J. Mohite; S. Sawant; K. Borah; S.

On one hand, the banking in India goes via the impact of interest rate liberalization and income decline because of the narrowing interest-rate spread. On the alternative hand, it is also tormented by economic amendment, digitalization, and monetary innovations. Hence, the banking agency requires urgent revision and is in seek of recent increase route. As such, blockchains may also need to transfigure the captioned generation of the price clearing and credit score rating records systems in banks, thus elevating and transforming them. Blockchain applications moreover promote the formation of “multi-center, weakly intervened” frameworks, so you can enhance the overall performance of the banking agency. However, in spite of permission tons less and autonomous nature of blockchains, the regulation and actual execution of a decentralized device are issues that need to be committed to.

"""A recommended market research based approach for small software companies for improving systematic reuse capability in delivering customized software solutions""","""Small software companies can neither be typical software product company like Microsoft, nor afford to develop each customized application for individual customer from clean slate without taking into consideration of reuse. Systematic reuse is an opportunity of continued cost reduction and quality improvement in software delivery. Small software companies in Bangladesh and the rest of the world need to exploit this opportunity to deal with ever increasing competitive market forces. Systematic reuse largely depends on the scope of delivering customized software applications in the same market segment repeatedly to multiple customers. Understanding the market for defining the generic software application concept which will be customized for meeting individual customer's demand and expectation in a profitable manner is difficult. Thorough market analysis provides basic inputs for defining generic product concept for launching customized software application for delivering services targeting suitable market segments. Choosing an appropriate market research methodology is challenging within the context where the market forces for software application are rapidly changing. And a successful new service launch around customized application delivery by targeting an attractive market segment is thought by many to be the key to business growth and profitability. The problem of establishing a successful new business around a generic software product concept is not challenging because of shortage of ideas, but rather problems exist in proper analysis of the market, studying different market segments, targeting the attractive segment, minimizing development expenses, pricing product appropriately, adopting reuse capability for continued price reduction and quality improvement to deal with evolving market forces and marketing the new product. This paper, therefore, suggests the application of market research methodology to screen new software application ideas based on market analysis and shows how a software company can combine market research with new software product development to provide exciting customized software applications that better meet consumer requirements and make the company profitable. Both state-of-art-review and filed investigation have been performed to assess global as well as local practices of market research methodology in different industries including the software industry.

"""Development of Domestic Animals Shelter Environment Monitoring System using Internet of Things (IoT)""","""In India, domestic animals play a major role in Indian economics. It is a parallel source of income for the farmer and is mostly used for work and service purposes. These animals are the most important assets of farmers, so their protection and survival in shelters are becoming major issues. Like the high and low temperatures of the animals shelters, drinking water level problems in the water tanks, harmful gases found in the animals shelters, and most of the time external animals enter the animal shelters, all these problems are faced by the animals in the shelters. In high temperatures, cow behavior changes and also affects the health of cows. If the drinking water level is low, this affects the milk production of the cow. Many times, an unknown person spreads flammable liquid near the animal shelter, which often ignites the fire in the shelter. For this reason, farmers lose their animals. Through the IoT, information and sustainable embedded solutions are provided through this research work. These devices monitor the animal shelter’s environmental parameters and send information about the shelter using Blynk Cloud. Using this app, the farmer can control the shed’s activity, and if anything harmful is found, this device will send an alert message to the farmer. The second part of this device is to check the security of the animal shelter. If any movement is found near the animal shelter, this instantly sends a warning to the farmer. For detection of any other movement of the animal, a PIR sensor is used. This sensor detects movement, sends an alert, and captures the image of any other animal using a Pi camera. This camera was used to capture the image if any harm was found. Using this device, farmers can solve the various problems of domestic animal shelters.""",,"""M. Pillewan; R. Agrawal; N.

In order to identify the suitability of different regions, 11 defined criteria, including solar radiation, average annual temperatures, distance from power transmission lines, distance from major roads, distance from residential area, built up, slope, aspect agricultural areas, water bodies, streams are identified. The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) was used to determine the normalized weight of each parameter. In addition, the work also utilized sensitivity analysis (SA) to calculate the effective weight of each individual parameter used in this research. Based on these effects and variation indices of the said parameters, new effective weights were determined and were used to create PV site suitability. The AHP Method demonstrated that the insolation, slope, aspect factors has a high importance in the suitability PV site, other factors like agricultural areas, built up and water bodies considered as exclusion parameters and shows a moderate importance, finally parameters like distance from power lines and cities considered as weak factors. Final results showed that the map offers a PV farms that cover 3% equivalent to 113 280 Ha of the total surface.""",,"""R. Azmi; H. Amar; I.

"""Automated Horticulture for Farmers Using IoT""","""India is a country that focuses on raising crops. The agricultural understanding was everything to our ancient populations. The majority of Indians depend on agriculture for their daily needs, and it has a significant impact on the nation's economy. Irrigation becomes challenging in dry areas or cases of little rainfall. To provide the best results and safeguard farmers, it must be forced upon them. A substantial role is played by horticulture, a subsector of agriculture, in the economy, human nutrition, gender mainstreaming, and employment. Fruits, vegetables, flowers, spices, and sauces are examples of horticultural goods, which have continuously increased and now make up a significant portion of the agricultural trade. The purpose of the automatic irrigation control system is to decrease the efforts of the human operator (gardener) in horticulture operations. The goal of the horticulture system is to maintain measures of food security. Farmlands have historically had their soil moisture levels checked manually. This is frequently time-consuming and ineffective, thus a method that is effective at regulating and keeping track of soil moisture levels is required. To communicate data from the board to the user's smartphone or laptop, this study presents an Internet of Things (IoT)-based soil moisture monitor that uses ESP32 with an integrated Wi-Fi module to monitor soil moisture level. The soil moisture monitors measure the amount of water in the soil and notify the farmer when the moisture sensor's predetermined threshold rate rises or falls, indicating overwatering or underwatering, respectively. This control system is based on an Arduino that has been coded in embedded C. Data from the sensor is also transmitted during this procedure, first to the cloud and subsequently to the database server. By ensuring that water is not wasted, the proposed soil moisture monitor's evaluation utilizing ThingSpeak.""",,"""N. P; M. V; C. Vasundhara; K. Koushik; B. S. Sumanth; P.

"""A dual-frequency spaceborne SAR mission concept""","""Since the 2007 National Academy of Science “Decadal Survey” report “Earth Science and Applications from Space: National Imperatives for the Next Decade and Beyond” [1], the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has been studying concepts for a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mission to determine Earth change in three disciplines - ecosystems, solid earth, and cryospheric sciences. One of the most promising and original concepts involves an innovative international partnership between NASA and the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). Previous NASA concepts had focused on exploiting an L-band array-fed reflector SAR configuration that enabled > 200 km swath at full SAR resolution and full polarimetry simultaneously in order to meet requirements in all three disciplines [2]. The feed where the electronics are housed in this design is relatively compact compared to a planar phased array antenna with similar azimuth resolution capability. This compactness allows for straightforward addition of feed array elements at other frequencies. As the partnership concept with ISRO developed, it became clear that flying dual L- and S-band SAR capabilities, with L-band electronics supplied by NASA and S-band electronics by ISRO, would satisfy science and application requirements of the US and India. A dual-frequency fully polarimetric SAR with the potential for global coverage every 12 days would offer unprecedented capability that researchers could exploit in new and exciting ways.""",,"""P.

"""Serendipity of Sharing: Large-Scale Measurement and Analytics for Device-to-Device (D2D) Content Sharing in Mobile Social Networks""","""The heavy multimedia traffic produced by mobile users poses great challenges for the mobile network operators, especially in the areas with large user densities but limited cellular network capacities (e.g. India). Recently, many studies demonstrate that exploiting the device-to- device(D2D) content sharing in offline Mobile Social Networks is a promising solution to cellular data offloading. However, such approaches are based on either unrealistic assumptions, or limited data analytics caused by small data size (e.g. hundreds of MSN users) or single-dimensional feature (e.g. human mobility only), which severely restricts their applications in practice. To address this issue, this paper performs the first large-scale data measurement and multi-feature analytics of D2D content sharing. Specifically, by using Apache Spark over a 20-server cluster, we analyze the behaviors of 30 million users (with 40 billion D2D transmissions and 16 million content files) of Xender, a leading global D2D sharing platform. Several important features are studied, including performance basics, content properties, location relations, meeting dynamics, and social characteristics. Furthermore, as a proof-of-concept study of our analytics, we also develop a multi-feature learning based framework, which demonstrates the large potentials of predicting and recommending D2D sharing activities using machine learning methods.""",,"""X.

"""Manufacturing experiences of large stroke welded disc bellows for nuclear applications""","""Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR) is a 500Mwe, Mixed Oxide (MOX) fueled and sodium cooled fast breeder reactor, which is in advanced stage of its commissioning. PFBR employs inclined fuel transfer machine (IFTM) for ex-vessel transfer during reactor fuel handling. Nested ripple type welded disc bellows are used as primary leak tight barrier in the shield plug of IFTM. The welded disc bellows are developed and manufactured indigenously. The material of construction of these bellows is AM 350, which is precipitation hardened stainless steel. The stroke to length ratio of the bellows is 0.75. Manufacturing of the welded disc bellows (in AM 350) with such a high stroke to length ratio is a first of its kind work in India. The material of the bellows needs to be heat treated to get intended mechanical properties. During initial trails several challenges are overcome with respect to manufacturing, heat treatment and quality assurance of the bellows. The bellows consist of 400 numbers of weld joints. Premature failures of the bellows at the welds joining two discs are observed during initial trails which are due to the condition of the raw material. The problem is solved by solution annealing of the raw material and ensuring the material is in its `H' grade. Parameters such as welding current, weld size and the profile of the discs are arrived by series of mockups. Procedure and fixtures for carrying out helium leak testing during various stages of the manufacturing are developed. Microscopic examination of the weld joint is carried out to check the width and depth of penetration of weld. Heat treatment of the long and flexible bellows is challenging and during initial trails, permanent deformation of the bellows is observed. The problem is solved by designing proper fixtures for heat treatment. Cycle life testing of the bellows is carried out and the bellows are qualified for reactor application. This paper details the technical challenges faced during the indigenous development and the solution employed to overcome the problems.""",,"""S. C. S. P. K. Krovvidi; B. K. Sreedhar; N.

"""A global space policy that would revive space exploration""","""Almost every nation today relies on space-based technology for communications, weather forecasting, satellite navigation and resource management, either through indigenous programs or through programs run by its allies. As such, it is safe to say that every country is a space-faring nation. However, when it comes to space science and technology, attention must be directed towards countries that possess the ability to launch payloads. Russia, Japan, China, ESA, India, Israel, Iran and the United States form an exclusive club of nations that not only possess launch capability but also dominate research and development in space sciences. With the exception of the ESA, whose space policy is dictated by its member states and primarily serves the EU, all other countries have national space programs governed by a dedicated space policy. However, all states including the EU have the following objectives in common: 1. Development and exploitation of space applications to serve the state's public policy objectives, 2. Ensuring that the state's national security and defense needs are met with regards to space, 3. Securing unrestricted access to critical technologies allowing states to pursue independent applications, and 4. To further international collaboration between like minded nations through improved coordination of international activities and by setting in place a better mechanism for sharing of resources. Whilst the above nations agree in principal to the UN Outer Space Treaty, and they all consider space as a vital resource for ensuring national security. As such, any application or development of critical technologies is used primarily to bolster a state's national defense capability. Current national space programs run by these countries cover various commercial, civilian and military aspects. This cross discipline research and development has led to an extremely integrated industrial base, where drawing a line between civilian and military programs is often impossible. This hazy line has often hindered technology transfer even in commercial applications as companies grapple with stringent export control regulations. With respect to the United States, whilst ITAR has ensured that critical technology is not transferred without the states consent, many in Washington agree that the regulation fails to meet its objectives and must be overhauled. It has also hindered US companies wanting to sell their products outside the United States, prompting other nations to develop indigenous technologies and market them as ITAR-free. Although it is safe to assume that research and development with regards to space will be dominated by the United States and its partners in Europe for the foreseeable future, the recent recession has caused financial strains on both sides of the Atlantic causing drastic changes with regards to space budgets and the future outlook for both NASA and ESA. This paper briefly discusses why emerging nations might consider investing in a national space program, and factors that would determine its success. It also focuses on how the establishment of a global space program could prove to be an innovative and cost-effective way of ensuring a robust space industry that serves the social and political objectives of member nations whilst promoting a global technological base that fosters innovation, growth and sustainable development.""",,"""T.

Around 37 million people across the globe are blind, over 15 million of which are from India. In spite of all the technological advancements in the recent decade very little has been done for the blind people. The visually impaired suffer from a wide range of difficulties since they lack the primary information for circumventing obstacles and dangers in their path. Navigating or perhaps simply walking down a crowded street may pose significant difficulty. As a result of which, many people with low vision have to depend either on a friend or family member to help them navigate through the unknown environments. Our fundamental aim is to create a prototype which will alleviate the misery of the blind people. This system encompasses three technologies or modules-Ultrasonic sound for obstacle detection coupled with gyroscope sensor to trigger ultrasonic wave pulse, Global positioning system (GPS) and Global system for mobile (GSM). All of these modules combined with an Arduino board unite to produce a system which allows blind people navigate through any kind of environment. The system also tracks the location in real time and updates the location on a web portal through which the family members of the visually impaired can track the person and have knowledge about his/her whereabouts. Furthermore, the system also facilitates the user with a special panic button, this button is designed to be used in case of any in development of an emergency or a possible threat.

"""A stochastic approach towards inclusive rural development using demographic data""","""Technology has advanced immensely in India in the recent years but its advantage has not been wholly utilized by the rural parts of our country. Villages hold a diversified job environment where most jobs can be made highly profitable by establishing proper communication among various professions. Information awareness in cities is playing a major role in improving small scale businesses which is missing in villages. This can be achieved by using appropriate use of available technology in villages which will help us determine correlations in rural India. A demographic analysis using stochastic mechanisms focusing on specific aspects can be used to learn about villagers and target appropriate methods to improve their lifestyle by the application of technology. We attempt to extract the demographics (like age, gender, place, skill sets) of a person and find various overlaps of his/her job nature with other professionals in a specific geography. This analysis would give us insights on a lot of interrelations among the various professions which can be exploited to maximum extent so that we achieve higher levels of productivity. A stochastic approach on the demographic data can be used to achieve this and thereby we can expect an inclusive rural development. Since, there are high levels of uncertainty on a variety of parameters we go for a stochastic approach to carry out our analysis. If we take probability theory into consideration, a purely stochastic system is one which is randomly determined and also has a random probabilistic distribution. The pattern which is derived from this system can only be analyzed statistically but cannot be accurately predicted. The probabilistic patterns obtained finally would provide us insights of how rural development is being carried out in a village and what factors should we need to focus on a that village to ensure wholesome development.""",,"""Mukundaram P.; Pravien M.; Ram Thilak P.""",2015,10.1109/TIAR.2015.7358539,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7358539,IEEE Conferences

The applications of thermal and shortwave infrared remote sensing play a substantial role in systematically detecting and monitoring the coal fire. Over the last few decades, researchers have extensively examined the importance of spectral radiance for retrieving reliable pixel-integrated temperature threshold to delineate coal fire from its background. However, such an assumption does not necessarily consider the local information, thereby leading to difficulty in isolating the actual coal fire affected pixels. Therefore, we propose to utilise the channel specific reflectance to retrieve the thermally anomalous pixels in coal fire related applications using Landsat 8 OLI data.

"""Smart Mini Grid: An innovative distributed generation based energy system""","""With the depleting energy resources, enhancing energy-security and energy-access, particularly in emerging economies is one of the major challenges that one has to deal with. In addition to managing the existing energy resources, generating power effectively and intelligently is an equally important agenda at the national level in India. Supplementing the establishment of large power plants from conventional energy sources, there is also a need to focus on distributed small scale generation of power particularly from renewable energy sources. Although Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) need additional infrastructure and investment to connect them to the grid, these technologies obviate the need for an expensive transmission system and reduce transmission and distribution (T&D) losses. A better way to realize the emerging potential of distributed generation is to take a system approach which views generation and associated loads as a subsystem or a `Micro-grid' [1]. During disturbances, the generation and corresponding loads can separate from the distribution system to isolate the Micro-grid's load from the disturbance without harming the transmission grid's integrity. To deal with these crucial issues of power and energy, the more appropriate solution is the Smart Mini Grid system which can optimally and intelligently manage the load and distributed generation resources so that maximum utilization of the renewable energy resources with a lower installed renewable energy capacity and smaller batteries can be ensured by coordinating the energy demands with the electricity production, fossil fuel generation can be minimized through the more efficient control of energy loads and power quality can be improved The paper presents the relevance of Smart Mini Grid as well as its existing challenges. It has also briefly pointed out the major initiatives taken by various institutions/industry in the smart mini/micro-grid sectors in India. The main purpose of this paper is to present the design of TERI's own Smart Mini Grid system which integrated various distributed energy sources such as Solar PV, small wind electric generator Biomass gassifier system, Diesel-Set (DG) and showcase how such implementation can be used in other similar applications for improving the efficiency, reliability and flexibility of the overall system.""",,"""M.

"""Efficient Image Processing Technique for Authentication of Indian Paper Currency""","""Now a days due to the development in color printing technology the rate of counterfeit notes production and distribution is increasing. This is a massive problem, faced by almost all the countries. It affects the economy, sine it compromises the security of the real economy. Such counterfeit currencies are used to fuel nefarious motives, usually involving terrorist activities. According to the research, developing countries like India have been impacted by this very negatively. Even after the steps taken in 2016 to remove the counterfeits, by executing the demonetization of 500 and 1000 rupees bank notes in India the counterfeits of the new notes have begun circulating. This is due to the highly advanced technology adopted by the counterfeiters which makes the tracking of these counterfeit notes hard. This has become a very critical issue and the negative impact due to the counterfeit currency keeps rising. The only one solution for this problem for a common man is to detect the fake currency, by using the fake currency detector machine. These machines are used in banks and large scale business, but for a small business or for a common man these machines are not affordable. This paper gives the complete methodology of fake note detector machine, which is affordable even for a common man. By implementing the applications of image processing techniques we can find out whether the currency notes are fake or not. Image processing technique consists of a number of operations that can be performed on an image, some of which include image segmentation, edge detection, gray scale conversion etc. The proposed system will have advantages like simplicity, reliability and costs less.""",,"""R.

"""Validation of Dozee, a Ballistocardiography-based Device, for Contactless and Continuous Heart Rate and Respiratory Rate Measurement""","""Long-term acquisition of respiratory and heart signals is useful in a variety of applications, including sleep analysis, monitoring of respiratory and heart disorders, and so on. Ballistocardiography (BCG), a non-invasive technique that measures micro-body vibrations caused by cardiac contractions as well as motion caused by breathing, snoring, and body movements, would be ideal for long-term vital parameter acquisition. Turtle Shell Technologies Pvt. Ltd.'s Dozee device, which is based on BCG, is a contactless continuous vital parameters monitoring system. It is designed to measure Heart Rate (HR) and Respiratory Rate (RR) continuously and without contact in a hospital setting or at home. A validation study for HR and RR was conducted using Dozee by comparing it to the vitals obtained from the FDA-approved Patient Monitor. This was done in a sleep laboratory setting over 110 nights in 51 subjects to evaluate HR and over 20 nights in 17 subjects to evaluate RR at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore, India. Approximately 789 hours data for HR and approximately 112 hours data for RR was collected. Dozee was able to achieve a mean absolute error of 1.72 bpm for HR compared to the gold standard ECG. A mean absolute error of ∼1.24 breaths/min was obtained in determining RR compared to currently used methods. Dozee is ideal for long-term contactless monitoring of vital parameters due to its low mean absolute errors in measuring both HR and RR. Clinical Relevance— Continuous and long-term vitals monitoring is known to enable early screening of clinical deterioration, improve patient outcomes and reduce mortality. Current methods of continuous monitoring are overly complex, costly, and rely heavily on patient compliance. The proposed remote vitals monitoring solution based on BCG was found to be at par with gold standard methods of recording HR and RR. As a result, clinicians can use it to effectively monitor patients in both the hospital and at home.""",,"""V. Saran; R. Kumar; G. Kumar; K. Chokalingam; M. Rawooth; G.

"""Generation of vital event notifications from DHIS2 for strengthening CRVS system""","""Vital events such as birth, death, marriage and divorce are recorded by the civil registration systems, and they are the major sources of national vital statistics. In most of the developing and under-developed countries, the civil registration and vital statistics systems are non-existent or weak. As a consequence, fertility, mortality and other key demographic information are not calculated from actual data on a continuous basis, these data are rather estimated through survey and do not cover large segments of the population. However, vital statistics data are important to any government for proper planning, resource allocation and development. Manual birth and death registrations is time-consuming and inconceivable for a large population. Information technology has already become an effective tool in the civil registration processes, but the registrar general office for birth and death has to depend on the health department as the birth and death events occur at hospitals and health care facilities. Survey results show that birth registration rate within 45 days of birth is very low and it is only around 3% in Bangladesh. In order to strengthen registration system, coordination between registration agency and health department is necessary and a notification for birth/death event should be reported to the registration agency for further action. To address this issue, we have designed a system that will send a notification to the registrar general office when a birth record is obtained in the health information system. In Bangladesh, the District Health Information System version 2 (DHIS2) is used in the health department for aggregated data collection and reporting purpose. Thus we studied DHIS2 system to see the feasibility of generating birth and death notifications upon collection of field data by the community health workers and designed and implemented necessary interfaces for the field worker, DHIS2 and Registrar general office.

"""The AirSpeck Family of Static and Mobile Wireless Air Quality Monitors""","""The Automatic Urban and Rural Network (AURN) [1] is a set of high quality reference monitoring sites for recording air quality in the United Kingdom. They are costly to install and expensive to run, and are therefore limited in numbers. The data from these networks are used to inform regulatory compliance with the Ambient Air Quality Directives [2]. There is also a requirement to monitor air pollution at sufficiently high spatial and temporal resolutions around people to estimate personal exposure to particulates, and gases such as Nitrogen Dioxide and Ozone for better understanding their health impacts. Such high resolution measurements can also be used for validating the air quality models' estimates of variability over space and time due to complex interactions. Networks of air-quality monitors using inexpensive sensors offer a cost-effective alternative approach for recording trends in air quality at a higher spatial resolution, albeit not as accurately as the reference monitoring sites. This paper describes the design, implementation, and deployment of a family of air quality monitors: stationary (AirSpeck-S) monitors for measuring ambient air quality, and mobile wearable AirSpeck-P for monitoring personal exposure to air borne particulates (PM10, PM2.5 and PM1), and the gases - Nitrogen Dioxide and Ozone. Results are presented for characterising the ambient air quality in public spaces gathered from people wearing the AirSpeck-P monitors who are out and about in two cities as pedestrians (Edinburgh, Scotland) and as car passengers (Delhi, India).

"""Assessing Impact of Carbon-smart Farming Practices in Rice with Mobile Crowdsensing""","""Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) is an important constituent of measures that govern soil health. Sequestration of carbon in the soil is a major growing focus of sustainability initiatives world-wide to reduce carbon footprint in the atmosphere and counter the effects of global warming. India is the world's largest rice producer by area, estimated at about 44.0 million hectares. Sustainable crop and land management practices play a crucial role in enabling more carbon to be absorbed by the soils and potentially generate carbon-credits which could be traded. Mobile Crowdsensing (MCS) can play a pivotal role in this by serving as a channel to acquire the data and generate insights to take in-season decisions and get a compliance-view on carbon-smartness of farm-operations. We present our study to digitally assess through crowdsensing the carbon smartness and stock of different agricultural fields in the Cauvery Delta Zone (CDZ) of Tamil Nadu, India. A set of ten selected farmers were divided into two observation groups CSCP-1 and CSCP-2. CSCP-1 followed organic practices and CSCP-2 followed integrated nutrient management practices with inorganic components. AI in the form of imaging with deep learning was used to validate across both the groups the granularity of operations like tillage that have a significant impact on the level of carbon sequestration. A process model approach was used to simulate the temporal changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) for all the farmers to serve as a continuous feedback on carbon footprint in response to operations reported. SOC levels were obtained for the entire rice season including pre-sowing and post-harvest periods where CSCP-1 farmers sequestrated more carbon than CSCP-2 farmers in general. Results showed an increase of 0.51 tC/ha in carbon stock for CSCP-1 farmers at the end of the season while the corresponding increase was 0.23 tC/ha for CSCP-2 farmers. Within the CSCP-2 group that adopted inorganic practices, farmers following intensive tillage sequestrated even less soil organic carbon at 0.17 tC/ha. MCS coupled with AI and process models therefore can help evolve a real-time carbon-smartness profile for every farm towards better strategic and management decisions.""",,"""R. Kulat; M. Sakkan; P.

"""Zigbee and GSM based patient health monitoring system""","""Care of critically ill patient, requires spontaneous & accurate decisions so that life-protecting & lifesaving therapy can be properly applied. Statistics reveal that every minute a human is losing his/her life across the globe. More close in India, everyday many lives are affected by heart attacks and more importantly because the patients did not get timely and proper help. This paper is based on monitoring of patients. We have designed and developed a reliable, energy efficient patient monitoring system. It is able to send parameters of patient in real time. It enables the doctors to monitor patient's health parameters (temp, heartbeat, ECG, position) in real time. Here the parameters of patient are measured continuously (temp, heartbeat, ECG) and wirelessly transmitted using Zigbee. This project provides a solution for enhancing the reliability and flexibility by improving the performance and power management of the patient monitoring system. In the current proposed system the patient health is continuously monitored and the acquired data is analyzed at a centralized ARM microcontroller. If a particular patient's health parameter falls below the threshold value, an automated SMS is sent to the pre-configured Doctor's mobile number using a standard GSM module interfaced to the ARM microcontroller. Here, we are using Zigbee for wireless transmission.

"""Autonomous Surface Vehicle for Real-time Monitoring of Water Bodies in Bangladesh""","""In this project, we have tried to develop a system to monitor water quality data of some water bodies in Dhaka city using a small autonomous hovering boat. It is a matter of concern that the water we have access to in Bangladesh is polluted and lacks a proper monitoring system. To manage and protect water, reliable and dynamic water monitoring is a must. Water monitoring systems that exist today require human intervention and expensive methodologies. Moreover, it is difficult to gather, analyze and index water quality data using these conventional systems. This problem can be solved by automating the process and reducing the dependency on existing flawed systems. The proposed project uses a miniature boat shaped automated hovering platform for mobility in water which is guided by a GPS and compass. The device consists of several water quality sensors for on-board data collection. At the same time, a small pump is used to collect water samples for laboratory tests and further analysis. Further, the system is integrated in a communication system to autonomously store data on real time servers through internet connectivity. Being lightweight and rechargeable the portable device can be taken to remote places conveniently. Therefore, this autonomous GPS guided water monitoring system can have a positive impact on water quality monitoring as well as assessment of water quality parameters.""",,"""S. R. Arko; R. B.

"""Smart farming—A prototype for field monitoring and automation in agriculture""","""The agricultural productivity of India is gradually declining due to destruction of crops by various natural calamities and the crop rotation process being affected by irregular climate patterns. Also, the interest and efforts put by farmers lessen as they grow old which forces them to sell their agricultural lands, which automatically affects the production of agricultural crops and dairy products. This paper mainly focuses on the ways by which we can protect the crops during an unavoidable natural disaster and implement technology induced smart agro-environment, which can help the farmer manage large fields with less effort. Three common issues faced during agricultural practice are shearing furrows in case of excess rain or flood, manual watering of plants and security against animal grazing. This paper provides a solution for these problems by helping farmer monitor and control various activities through his mobile via GSM and DTMF technology in which data is transmitted from various sensors placed in the agricultural field to the controller and the status of the agricultural parameters are notified to the farmer using which he can take decisions accordingly. The main advantage of this system is that it is semi-automated i.e. the decision is made by the farmer instead of fully automated decision that results in precision agriculture. It also overcomes the existing traditional practices that require high money investment, energy, labour and time.""",,"""K. Sreeram; R. S. Kumar; S. V. Bhagavath; K. Muthumeenakshi; S.

"""An Artificial Intelligence and Cloud Based Collaborative Platform for Plant Disease Identification, Tracking and Forecasting for Farmers""","""Plant diseases are a major threat to farmers, consumers, environment and the global economy. In India alone, 35% of field crops are lost to pathogens and pests causing losses to farmers. Indiscriminate use of pesticides is also a serious health concern as many are toxic and biomagnified. These adverse effects can be avoided by early disease detection, crop surveillance and targeted treatments. Most diseases are diagnosed by agricultural experts by examining external symptoms. However, farmers have limited access to experts. Our project is the first integrated and collaborative platform for automated disease diagnosis, tracking and forecasting. Farmers can instantly and accurately identify diseases and get solutions with a mobile app by photographing affected plant parts. Real-time diagnosis is enabled using the latest Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms for Cloud-based image processing. The AI model continuously learns from user uploaded images and expert suggestions to enhance its accuracy. Farmers can also interact with local experts through the platform. For preventive measures, disease density maps with spread forecasting are rendered from a Cloud based repository of geo-tagged images and micro-climactic factors. A web interface allows experts to perform disease analytics with geographical visualizations. In our experiments, the AI model (CNN) was trained with large disease datasets, created with plant images self-collected from many farms over 7 months. Test images were diagnosed using the automated CNN model and the results were validated by plant pathologists. Over 95% disease identification accuracy was achieved.

Descriptive statistics revealed that most of the nursing teachers were female, a master’s degree holder, with an academic rank of instructor, not a licensed professional teacher, and a permanent and full-time employee at private institutions in the Visayas region of the Philippines. Moreover, they do not play mobile games and do not have an experience when it comes to MGBL. Lastly, Spearman’s correlation analysis revealed that Theory of Planned Behavior factors correlated positively with the intention of nursing teachers to use MGBL. This descriptive-exploratory study serves as a preliminary exploration of MGBL in nursing education and a future study will cover the prediction of nursing teachers’ intention to use MGBL in the classroom.""",,"""M.

"""Communication system design for white-fi (802.11af)""","""“Four and half billion people around the world still aren't connected to the Internet!” The gap between India's rural and urban areas, both economically and technologically, is enormous. It is quite obvious that the economic imbalance between India's metros and her villages is the most significant reason for miserable Internet adoption statistics currently found in the country's rural areas. People in the metropolitan cities enjoy the utilities offered by the Internet as a routine privilege while their rural counterparts are yet to come to terms with the convenience and efficiency of the Internet. Many government projects such as the NOFN (National Optical Fiber Network) and the APSFL (AP State Fiber Network Limited) meant to solve this divide are awfully slow and would undoubtedly encounter numerous cost overruns. A solution to this problem would be to tap into the potential of the unused TV spectrum and use it to provide Wi-Fi based broadband connectivity to geographically remote regions of the country. A key factor in deploying such a solution would be to design the related hardware effectively, as described in this paper. The hardware discussed consists of a UHF translator to up/down convert the 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi signals to the appropriate unused TV band in the UHF spectrum. We operate in the UHF Band-IV which extends from 470–582 MHz and comprises 14 channels of 8MHz each. The first section of this article provides a brief overview of the motivation behind our work and the potential applications of the proposed hardware prototype. In the second section, we present a brief description of the project and associated novelty when compared to existing state-of-the-art in the field of White Space communication. In the third section, the UHF translator design is outlined. The third section of this paper also talks about the Raised Cosine Filter and its roll-off factor, which is a primary constraint to ensure design compliance with the IEEE 802.11af standard.

"""Review of Intelligent Algorithms for Breast Cancer Control: a Latin America Perspective""","""Breast cancer in women is a worldwide health problem that is one of the main causes of death. This situation is accentuated in Latin America and the Caribbean countries, where about 159 women die daily from this disease. The World Health Organization recommends focusing on Prevention and Early Detection of cancer to reduce mortality. However, this requires a great deal of information processing and analysis by experts, who require the support of technology to perform these tasks promptly. In recent years, the use of so-called intelligent algorithms has increased to support the fight against breast cancer. The authors summarized the studies published between January 2016 and June 2021, highlighting the current situation and opportunities for Latin America and the Caribbean. Studies were selected using the following terms: intelligent algorithms, assessment metrics, stages of breast cancer control addressed, data sources, data types, female population with breast cancer under study and the countries of the authors who have written articles on this subject. In this study, after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria 226 articles were selected from a total of 1,105 articles found in the ACM digital library, IEEE Explore, Nature, PubMed, Scopus (Science Direct) and Springer Link databases. Publication between January 2016 and June 2021, breast cancer as main interest, algorithm and data type information, along with compliance with the general question were the inclusion criteria, while, being a research article, compliance with the three subqueries and availability, were the exclusion criteria. Using a spreadsheet as based tool to collect and analyze the data, the study found that the most used elements were: SVM, RF and DT algorithms; accuracy as assessment metric; public information sources; data on tumors (size and shape, among others); USA information sources; India as the country of the first authors who wrote the most articles of the selected papers; and Diagnosis and treatment as the most addressed stage of cancer control. Results in this review paper provide an overview of the application of intelligent algorithms against breast cancer. In this regard, the gaps that were detected are: the Prevention stage of cancer control has not been addressed with intelligent algorithms, and the Early Detection stage has been very little addressed; private data sources could be beneficial in this type of research, but the difficulty in accessing them is a barrier for researchers. In addition, although Latin America and the Caribbean have a significant death rate from breast cancer, patients in this region have not been the subject of study and the participation of researchers on the subject has been almost nonexistent. Finally, there seems to be a great opportunity to generate proposals based on intelligent algorithms with low cost and time to implement that could directly impact patient survival, improving the health systems of the countries in the region.""",,"""J.

"""Effect of Voltage Dip on the Operation of Synchronous Reluctance Motor Coupled to a Constant Torque Load""","""Synchronous reluctance motors (SynRM) are increasingly being considered for various application due to their rugged structure and maintenance-free operation. Considering that remote locations in India are fed by a weak power grid, it is necessary to know the consequences faced by an SynRM coupled to a constant torque load, if a sustained voltage dip (beyond the tolerable limits of the motor)occurs at the terminals of the motor. This work presents a novel analysis of the behavior of the motor when a sustained voltage dip, beyond the tolerable voltage dip margin, occurs at the motor terminals. The changes in speed, torque, current and other operating quantities after a large voltage dip occurrence, are also investigated thoroughly. This analysis is supported by simulations in MATLAB/Simulink as well as experimental results.

"""Application of UAV for Pest, Weeds and Disease Detection using Open Computer Vision""","""Sustainable agriculture is an important field where not much attention is given though it is highly necessary, so as to monitor the growth of crops for their efficient growth in most nutritious ways. For effective growth of crops, lot of chemicals like fertilizers and pesticides are used, however, excessive usage of them results in damage to land and water resources. The attack of pests is a major criteria which affect crop yield. Various crop monitoring technologies are available which are highly expensive and not all farmers can afford. Moreover in India, farmers are not capable of understanding the operation and handling of such sophisticated technology. In this paper, we propose a system which is cheaper and easy to operate with multiple application. The proposed system uses a technology which utilizes machine learning and ANN algorithms using UAV that helps us to locate regions that are affected by diseases and pesticides so that we can particularly focus on the regions that are affected and apply chemicals only in that particular area, with the entire system being cost effective. For this purpose, we divide the entire area into n x n segments and using image processing, the segmented areas are analysed and processed using Ardupilot and a central operating system to monitor using python and open CV, giving the simplest user interface for monitoring purposes.""",,"""R.

However, the DGA fault interpretation using processing methods has significant obstacles due to the minimal data availability, considerable vagueness in DGA interpretation, applicability, and model performance. It is necessary to comprehend the impact of data preparation and databalancing on the DGA database as a potential issue to upgrade the current model to the industry. This work uses vast, extremely diverse DGA data samples of in-service transformers from several sites in Himachal Pradesh, India, to create a practical methodology for fault classification. In this condition interpretation work, we analyze various parameters of DGA outputs and assess the state of the oil. A total of 421 DGA test databases were collected, and we trained the various algorithmic models in machine learning to predict the condition of oil.

"""A Comparative Study of Epileptic Seizure Detection Framework using SVM and ELM""","""Poverty and lack of health awareness are major reasons for illnesses, particularly neurology-related problems in India. Epilepsy is one such problem that affects the brain by causing seizures termed as epileptic seizures. People in rural areas believe epileptic attacks to be results of influence of black magic and resorted to unscientific practices for treatment. Repeated occurrence of seizures could lead to death. The early detection and treatment would cure 70 percent of the cases. The study of the epileptic activity can be done using EEG recordings of the brain. Although many software packages offers complete tool set for complex EEG analysis which is not as candid compared to brain-imaging techniques user need to choose appropriate framework suitable for their application scenario. In this paper we propose four different combination of feature extraction and classification techniques for detecting epileptic seizures and this study aims to compare the results in context of accuracy. The combination of discrete wavelet transform for feature extraction and early learning machine algorithm for classifications generates 90.1% accuracy in classifying epileptic seizures. Also this framework reduces computation time by selection of proper EEG channel data by preprocessing which helps to develop an expert system which emulates the decision making of a human expert.""",,"""B.

"""Unconstrained face recognition: Establishing baseline human performance via crowdsourcing""","""Research focus in face recognition has shifted towards recognition of faces “in the wild” for both still images and videos which are captured in unconstrained imaging environments and without user cooperation. Due to confounding factors of pose, illumination, and expression, as well as occlusion and low resolution, current face recognition systems deployed in forensic and security applications operate in a semi-automatic manner; an operator typically reviews the top results from the face recognition system to manually determine the final match. For this reason, it is important to analyze the accuracies achieved by both the matching algorithms (machines) and humans on unconstrained face recognition tasks. In this paper, we report human accuracy on unconstrained faces in still images and videos via crowd-sourcing on Amazon Mechanical Turk. In particular, we report the first human performance on the YouTube Faces database and show that humans are superior to machines, especially when videos contain contextual cues in addition to the face image. We investigate the accuracy of humans from two different countries (United States and India) and find that humans from the United States are more accurate, possibly due to their familiarity with the faces of the public figures in the YouTube Faces database.

In India number of accidents have occurred due to crowd environment in public areas like Shopping malls, Airports, pilgrimage, Temples, Political Meetings etc.,. In order to avoid such accidents, we need to estimate the density of people in crowd environment. In this paper, our proposed method is divided into two fold. In first, we propose density estimation of the crowd size. Secondly, count the number of people in the crowd. As crowd density increases, the occlusion between the people also increases. In order to avoid such problem in crowd we can use Improved Adaptive K-GMM Background subtraction method to extract the exact foreground in real time applications to avoid the estimation problem. By applying boundary detection algorithm, we can estimate the size of the crowd. The number of people in a crowd is counted by using algorithm “canny edge detector”, “connected component labeling” method and “bounding box with centroid” method.

"""Cogeneration An Emerging trend in India for Energy Crisis""","""The increasing price of fossil fuels, the increasing need for the power supply reliability and security and the increasing demand for energy-efficient technologies are tending to favor the application of small power generation solutions. An excellent approach to these solutions is to install combined heat and power systems that can be configured to operate under normal conditions to supply local power needs but with grid back up. Cogeneration is also called 'total energy' or 'combined heat and power'. It is the use of a single fuel such as gas to simultaneously produce useful heat and electricity from the same source. While cogeneration matches other power generation options in terms of the investment costs, it provides an indigenous source of the electrical energy for the nation, saves on foreign exchange, is a tool for the employment and wealth creation and agent for abatement of environmental degradation. A significant potential exists for generating electricity from various products such as bagasse, a waste product of the cane milling process, agricultural, animal, municipal solid waste etc. Several studies in India and other parts of the world, point to the sugar industry as a prime candidate for supplying low cost, non-conventional power via cogeneration. The different systems have been designed for electricity generation from all types of wastes. The major power outages in North America and Europe have resulted in focus on developing energy technologies like domestic scale micro CHP (combined heat and power) to reduce the reliance of the consumers on large generators and the grid. This paper focuses on coal-based cogeneration. A case study of 24 MW coal based cogeneration plant is discussed in details.

"""Detection and extraction of pantograph region from bank cheque images""","""Image matching and object extraction have been at the heart of computer vision research since the last two decades invigorated by the introduction of SIFT features by David Lowe. This paper proposes an approach for the same for its application to a specific problem, i.e. to extract the rectangular pantograph region from the cheque images used by banks in India. The proposed approach relies upon maximally stable extremal regions (MSER) for the keypoint localization and followed by speeded up robust features (SURF) for feature description. Then, these features from the template are matched with those in the cheque image. After the matching is performed, location of the detected blobs is identified and a binary image is generated with these locations as white and the rest of the background as black. From this binary image, the region of interest can be figured out by simple procedure based on iteration of a rectangular mask sized window throughout the binary image. The location having the largest density of the minority pixels is determined and this region is further extracted out from the initial input image. This is the first attempt of its kind to create an automated technique for extraction of the pantograph region from a cheque image. The results are encouraging. Also, this extraction of the pantograph region can be further applied on other images where it is being used to provide document security.""",,"""A. Ali; R.

"""Development of Normal Conducting Cavity Magnet for 42 GHz 200 kW Long Pulse Gyrotron""","""Gyrotrons are high-frequency, high-power microwave sources with potential applications in plasma generation, energy generation, spectroscopy, and security. The Department of Science and Technology initiated the development of a 42 GHz, 200 kW, continuous wave (CW) gyrotron for the Indian Tokamak system through a multi-institutional project. The activity is targeted toward indigenous development of India’s first high-power gyrotron. In gyro-devices, frequency of operation is determined by the cyclotron frequency, and thereby the magnetic field. The development of a high-field intensity normal conducting cavity magnet was an imperative step during the testing and integration of the gyrotron tube assembly to achieve the desired beam transmission with a moderate operating cost. A high and spatially homogeneous magnetic field (1.61 T) is required to be established in the beam–wave interaction region by the cavity magnet. The desired magnetic field, as a function of axial distance from the gun to the collector, is governed by the requirements of gun optics, focusing field in the interaction region, and the adiabatic expansion of the beam into the collector. A water cooled electromagnet has been designed to produce the requisite magnetic field in the cavity region over an axial length of 40 mm with field homogeneity better than ±0.35%. Magnet design was optimized to meet the field requirements in the cavity and cathode gun. Magnetic field simulations were carried out in conjunction with the electrostatic field and space charge analysis. This paper presents finite element computations, design optimization, development and testing of a continuous duty iron core electromagnet for a first harmonic interaction mode (TE03) gyrotron cavity. Magnetic, electrical, thermal, and hydraulic design of the electromagnet is discussed in this paper.""",,"""K. Singh; J. Itteera; R. R. Singh; S. Malhotra; D.

IPFS is a file system that helps to create a permanent and decentralized method for storing and accessing files. First, a user will upload his or her document, and the document will be uploaded to the Inter Planetary File System (IPFS). Once the document is uploaded, a unique hash is returned, which is also known as a CID (content identifier). This is used to uniquely identify the uploaded file on IPFS. Then, that CID is stored in the blockchain as a private variable, so not everyone can access it. When someone can access it, we will specify the conditions.""",,"""B. Bhandari; P. R. Vairagade; H.

"""Generalized Neural Network Approach for Global Solar Energy Estimation in India""","""In India, large areas of land are barren and sparsely populated, making these areas suitable as locations for large central power stations based on solar energy. India is located in the equatorial sun belt of the earth, thereby receiving abundant radiant energy from the sun. Estimating solar energy accurately is a big task to exploit the solar potential for power generation. A number of conventional and intelligent models are available; how- ever, the results are not satisfactory due to extreme simplicity of their parameterization. In this paper, application of generalized neural network (GNN), a modified approach of artificial neural network (ANN), is proposed to estimate solar energy to overcome the problems of ANN such as a large number of neurons and layers required for complex function approximation, which do not affect the training time only but also the fault tolerant capabilities of the ANN. The mean relative error in the estimation of global solar energy is found around 4% whereas the same using fuzzy logic is 6% approximately. Therefore, it is concluded that the GNN technique is found more accurate for the estimation of global solar energy.""",,"""M. Rizwan; M. Jamil; D. P.

"""Face Recognition and Identification Using Successive Subspace Learning for Human Resource Utilization Assessment""","""Attendance monitoring is an application of people counting with several use cases in various settings such as in corporate businesses and classrooms. Despite the vast number of possible applications, automated people counting or attendance monitoring applications in the Philippines are fairly uncommon. For example, establishments such as malls, supermarkets, terminals, and parks in the country still use manual counting. Their security personnel are given handheld counting devices to count the number of people entering the buildings or terminals. However, manual people counting, or attendance tracking methods are labor intensive, and thereby costly and time consuming. In spite of these issues, few establishments are interested in investing in automated counters as they tend to require devices or infrastructure (e.g., servers) which may be costly or impractical to scale. This paper aims to track a personnel's time management at work by monitoring his/ her dwell time in a dedicated workspace through face recognition.

In this arrangement, a voter has the option to cast a ballot from a place other than the one designated for them or from their favorite site. Vote counting will be made in an automated fashion under the proposed approach, saving a significant amount of period and allowing our nation’s Commission set for Election to declare the results in a much fast succession. Alongside the password-based authentication, we have also utilized the face-based authentication along with the successful implementation of the OpenCV in addition to the password validation.

"""Satellite Image Analysis for Disaster and Crisis-Management Support""","""This paper describes how multisource satellite data and efficient image analysis may successfully be used to conduct rapid-mapping tasks in the domain of disaster and crisis-management support. The German Aerospace Center (DLR) has set up a dedicated crosscutting service, which is the so-called ""Center for satellite-based Crisis Information"" (ZKI), to facilitate the use of its Earth-observation capacities in the service of national and international response to major disaster situations, humanitarian relief efforts, and civil security issues. This paper describes successful rapid satellite mapping campaigns supporting disaster relief and demonstrates how this technology can be used for civilian crisis-management purposes. During the last years, various international coordination bodies were established, improving the disaster-response-related cooperation within the Earth-observation community worldwide. DLR/ZKI operates in this context, closely networking with public authorities (civil security), nongovernmental organizations (humanitarian relief organizations), satellite operators, and other space agencies. This paper reflects on several of these international activities, such as the International Charter Space and Major Disasters, describes mapping procedures, and reports on rapid-mapping experiences gained during various disaster-response applications. The example cases presented cover rapid impact assessment after the Indian Ocean Tsunami, forest fires mapping for Portugal, earthquake-damage assessment for Pakistan, and landslide extent mapping for the Philippines""",,"""S.

"""Performance Analysis of Various Ionospheric Delay Corrections in Single-frequency GPS Positioning solution at a low latitude Indian location""","""Ionospheric delay is the most critical factor in satellite-based communication and navigation applications, often imparting serious threats to the trans ionospheric signal to affect the accuracy of measurements in the allied applications. The current technological advancements and diverse usages of single-frequency global positioning systems (GPS) based navigation and positioning applications in the mass market emphasize effective mitigation of ionospheric delay error as they are often restricted with precision-limited models. In the present paper, the performance of single-frequency positioning at a low latitude location Bangalore, India (Geographic coordinate: 13.02°N, 77.57°E) during 10-12 October 2021 by using five different ionospheric delay error mitigation techniques through RTKLIB, an open-source program package for standard and precise positioning through global navigation satellite system (GNSS) observations is evaluated. The number of satellite visibility, ground tracks of receiver locations, and deviations in East-West, North-South, and Up-Down directions are analyzed by implementing different ionospheric error mitigation models to suggest the best possible option in a single-frequency GPS positioning solution. The analysis shows that among all the available options, the broadcast Klobuchar model signifies relatively improved corrections in 2-dimensional positioning (N-S and E-W) despite limitations in its model specifications whereas the vertical error is relatively better estimated by the international GNSS service’s final global ionosphere maps (IGS-GIMs), followed by the broadcasted Klobuchar model coefficients. The outcome of this work supports the concerted efforts towards better navigation and positioning accuracies for the single-frequency GNSS users over the region.""",,"""R. K. Vankadara; B.

"""Intention to Use Social Media in Online and Blended Learning: Potential Predictors and Mediation of Collectivism""","""The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically impacted traditional classroom education and all the associated multi-stakeholders (Universities, teachers, and students). With education embracing online media, there is a need to develop sustainable models of education. Social media is a tool that can be effectively used to create sustainable development in higher education. In this context, this study emphasizes on the development of an empirical model for intention to use social media in online/blended learning in a multi-stakeholder (Universities, teachers, and students) context. A total of 330 samples were collected through an online survey from students/faculties of various public and private higher educational institutions in India. The data from the survey was analyzed employing Explorative Factor Analysis (EFA) using R-Studio and, Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and Path Analysis (AP) using Structure Equation Modelling (SEM) on the AMOS 20.0 software platform. Results demonstrate a significant impact of perceived privacy, perceived security, ICT facility, and trust, on the intention to use social media in educational institutions following online/blended learning methods. The mediation of collectivism is also confirmed in this study. Hence, our findings will add value to the existing literature on online/blended learning and the sustainable development of education. By implementing more stringent security and privacy policies, good Internet connectivity, better technology infrastructure, and excellent and smart features in mobile, tablets, and laptops social media and collective effort of students, instructors, and external student communities may generate trust in the stakeholders, motivating them to use social media as a tool in higher education.""",,"""S.

"""Garbage Classifying Application Using Deep Learning Techniques""","""Garbage disposal is a very important task in a healthy and green environment. With spreading awareness among the citizens of India regarding the importance of a clean environment to decrease the consumption of natural resources and garbage disposal, the recycling industry is booming. The quantity of generated trash in day-to-day life is affecting land, water, and air which causes a serious threat to the aquatic species and their surroundings and ultimately to humans if not managed properly. Conventional garbage disposal systems are on the rise and need accurate and efficient segmentation and recognition mechanisms. This demand coincides with the increase of computational capabilities of modern computer architectures and more effective algorithms for image recognition. To deal with this problem the garbage classification process is automated by building an image classifier using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and thereby decrease the time for the waste segregation and make it cost-effective. The idea behind making the process automated is to decrease human intervention and make this waste segregation process more productive. In this work, three different models are being tested for higher accuracy: Simple CNN, ResNet50, and VGG16 trained on various datasets of images, these are used to extract features from images and feed them into a classifier for dump/trash classification. The trained models are then fed to a mobile application that captures pictures in the real-time using camera. The experimental results conclude the performance of VGG16 using Transfer Learning being significantly higher than all other models for the purpose of Trash Classification and the performance of Simple CNN being better for Dump Classification.""",,"""A.

This paper demonstrates the design, development, and real-time field experimentation of an energy-efficient, PV based single-phase micro-inverter for rural/remote applications. The proposed dual-stage single-phase inverter takes the advantage of interleaved DC/DC boost converter for cancellation of 180ο phase-shifted harmonics and application of voltage doubler circuit results in a reduction of the transformer turns ratio with low flux leakage and thus endeavoring for better conversion efficiency at a reduced size of magnetics. Further, high-frequency switching at the first leg and low switching frequency at another leg of the full-bridge converter ensures lower switching losses at light load conditions. Experimental results are carried out at field location (latitude: 26.431°, longitude: 74.707°) in Rajasthan, India. The interleaved boost DC/DC converter efficiency is found approximately 91.73% at full load and 77.74% at 10% load. Micro-inverter overall efficiency is observed in between 57.34% to 91.6%.""",,"""A.

"""Maturity Grading and Macronutrient Deficiency Identification to Assist Tomato Growth in a Wick Hydroponic System Using an Xception-Based Convolutional Neural Network""","""Tomatoes are extensively cultivated around the world and are considered to be one of the most lucrative crops in the Philippines. Growing tomatoes is considered as a high-risk activity since it is susceptible to disease and pest attacks, and fluctuations in nutrient intake. One solution to these issues is to cultivate them in protected environments such as hydroponic systems. With these types of systems, it is important to have efficient classification of tomato maturity and accurate assessment of nutrient deficiencies to result in optimal growth and yield since conventional methods are time-consuming and prone to error. Several studies have been conducted to address these issues using image processing and deep learning. In this study, two Xception-based Convolutional Neural Network models were developed for tomato maturity grading and macronutrient deficiency identification in tomato plant leaves grown in a Wick Hydroponic System in the prospect of presenting better results among other existing approaches in classifying tomato maturity stages and macronutrient deficiencies. After gathering tomato and leaf images using a smartphone camera, a pre-trained image classification Xception model was retrained and optimized to classify unripe, half-ripe, and ripe tomatoes for maturity grading, and healthy, nitrogen-deficient, phosphorus-deficient, and potassium-deficient tomato plant leaves for macronutrient deficiency identification. The initial models indicated signs of overfitting but after adding Ll regularization and batch normalization, and reducing the number of dense layers, the maturity grading and macronutrient deficiency identification models obtained an accuracy of 93.3% and 97.3% respectively.""",,"""M.

"""BloCkEd: Blockchain-Based Secure Data Processing Framework in Edge Envisioned V2X Environment""","""There has been an increasing trend of moving computing activities closer to the edge of the network, particularly in smart city applications (e.g., vehicle-to-everything - V2X). Such a paradigm allows the end user's requests to be handled/processed by nodes at the edge of the network; thus, reducing latency, and preserving privacy of user data/activities. However, there are a number of challenges in such an edge computing ecosystem. Examples include (1) potential inappropriate utilization of resources at the edge nodes, (2) operational challenges in cache management and data integrity due to data migration between edge nodes, particularly when dealing with vehicular mobility in a V2X application, and (3) high energy consumption due to continuous link breakage and subsequent reestablishment of link(s). Therefore in this paper, we design a blockchain-based secure data processing framework for an edge envisioned V2X environment (hereafter referred to as BloCkEd). Specifically, a multi-layered edge-enabled V2X system model for BloCkEd is presented, which includes the formulation of a multi-objective optimization problem. In addition, BloCkEd comprises an optimal container-based data processing scheme, and a blockchain-based data integrity management scheme, designed to minimize link breakage and reducing latency. Using Chandigarh City, India, as the scenario, we implement and evaluate the proposed approach in terms of its latency, energy consumption, and service level agreement compliance.""",,"""G. S.

"""Target Detection in Hyperspectral Imagery Using Atmospheric-Spectral Modeling and Deep Learning""","""Target detection (TD) in spectral imagery is an evolving analytical perspective with broader application potential. The perceived distinctness of the spectral signatures of the materials of interest is exploited for detecting targets in hyperspectral imagery. Space–time varying atmospheric perturbances on the radiation reaching a remote sensor are major limitations for designing a successful TD framework. Incorporating atmospheric components into a TD framework is vital for practical applicability. Considered a general approach for flexibility, scalability, and optimal prediction, deep learning (DL) methods are increasingly used in various remote sensing applications. However, their potential for TD is relatively unexplored. Especially, the ability to provide training data sufficient for DL models and maintaining the functional relevance of the sparsely distributed targets in hyperspectral imagery are crucial for TD frameworks. This letter presents a novel method for the training of DL architecture, called deep spectral target detector (DSTD). The proposed method includes a semisupervised multiscenario forward radiative transfer modeling (RTM) for the simulation of spectral signatures of various targets as training data suitable for the functional requirements of a typical DL architecture. We implemented the DSTD on a TD application-specific benchmark AVIRIS-NG airborne hyperspectral imagery acquired over a study site near Ooty, India. Compared to the state-of-the-art statistical target detectors, the detection performance of the DSTD is superior to equivalent. Furthermore, RTM-based training yields a robust model, impervious to the atmospheric mismatches between target collection and TD environments, indicating the potential for a similar approach to develop efficient DL-based methods for TD in the future.""",,"""S.

In this paper, license plate localization process is carried out by weight based density map (WBDM) method, which is independent of such constraints. The proposed method also relaxes constraints in lighting conditions. The robustness of this method is well suited for application in countries like India where the appearance of plates varies widely. 1750 images were captured in different background scenes under various lighting conditions.

"""Object-Based Similarity Assessment Using Land Cover Meta-Language (LCML): Concept, Challenges, and Implementation""","""Land cover (LC) is an essential variable for environmental monitoring in many application domains. The detection of changes in LC can support the understanding of environmental dynamics. However, LC legends present a high degree of inconsistencies that significantly reduce their usability. This study investigates the effectiveness of ISO standard 19144-2, better known as Land Cover Meta-Language (LCML), to improve the standardization and harmonization of different LC taxonomies and maps. LCML vocabulary and syntactic rules facilitate the integration of natural resources information. LC classes are represented by a sequence of “Basic Elements” and attributes defined as “Properties” and “Characteristics.” Such elements are formalized in a Unified Modeling Language class diagram. This study presents first, a method to evaluate and score the “similarity” of different LCML legends, second, an application of the similarity assessment criteria to an area located in Bangladesh for translating its specific LCML legend into a different taxonomy, i.e., the System of Environmental Economic Accounting, and third, a Python implementation to be incorporated in new or already existing tools. The results obtained show that when class similarity assessment is carried out by Basic Elements only, the process performs well for simple classes. When classes are characterized by similar basic elements (e.g., biotic elements) structure, the introduction of class properties is needed to disambiguate complex situations. The findings indicate that the proposed methodology can exploit LCML land feature semantic representation. Moreover, it can be used for translating LCML classes into different taxonomies, for facilitating class comparison and change detection.""",,"""N. Mosca; A. Di Gregorio; M. Henry; R. Jalal; P.

"""Relevance of Grid Computing for India in the era of Cloud Computing""","""Grid Computing is often implemented by relying on the concept of sharing of available resources, in order to improve economies of scale and utilization. However, after the advent of Cloud Computing, the adoption of Grid Computing has been rather slow, and people wonder if it is still relevant, and whether Grid Computing truly matters. In a developing country like India where computer, smart phone and internet penetration is still low compared to richer nations, Grid Computing can make a huge difference in the adoption of scientific computing, by making niche resources available to the researchers. Grid Computing provides a framework to bridge the gap between what the researchers want and what they currently have. Grid aggregates available resources through efficient security mechanisms, meta-scheduling capabilities, and file transfer methodologies among others, and offers an unprecedented infrastructure for solving grand challenge problems.

"""Predictions and recommendations for the higher education institutions from Facebook social networks""","""We are living in the age of Higher Education (HE) 2.0, where the fastest growing social networking sites (SNS) is Facebook. It's been widely accepted as a platform for communications and collaborations. The students and Higher Education Professionals (HEP) which includes faculty members, administrators, management, etc. use to share their valuable resources. It's been notified that students are far more ahead in using communication technologies as compared to the Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) Professionals. In our research work, we analyse the social network graphs which are Facebook pages or groups having members like HEP, students, etc., related to Higher Education in India. We discovered that in some networks, members are less, but online posts and messages are huge in number. Student's active participations or interactions in the social networks can be done by Social Network Analysis (SNA) approaches. In our study, we explore the techniques for the SNA to detect the motifs or patterns in the Online Social Media Networks (OSMNs). These are produced by the interactions and the content exchanged among the users, students and professionals of HE in the social graph. In our previous research work, we used Network Analysis Software Applications (NASA) tools able to discover important architecture and fetching the core, perimetric and outlined members in the network. By these NASA applications, we can visualize, generate and summarize the buzz topics or the words by the active members of the network, which gives us a glimpse of the topic under discussion. We exploited the mining algorithms provided by the NASA tools like (Gephi, NodeXL, LikeAnalyzer and Wolfram Alpha). This helped us in assessing their presence and participation factor of the students and the higher education professionals in the social network graphs. Our study attempted to test for an affiliation that exists between Higher Education (HE) and the Social Networking Site (SNS) Facebook. Our research in analysis and finding related to social network analysis predicts that social networking on Facebook and higher education can work in parallel.""",,"""M. Madan; M. Chopra; M.

"""Identification Of Pedestrian Movement And Classification Using Deep Learning For Advanced Driver Assistance System""","""Prediction of pedestrian behavior is the most challenging task in today's era. Especially, in India, when a pedestrian is crossing the road it is very important to avoid accidents and slow down the traffic unnecessarily at the same time. The direction of movement of a pedestrian finds its application in autonomous driver assistance systems, security surveillance, medical applications to detect human posture abnormality, pedestrian analysis, biometric systems, robotics, etc. In order to improve the safety of the pedestrians and to enable the cars to drive independently or assist the driver in real life situations, people flow analysis along roadside, at road crossings and junctions is of utmost importance. There have been many proposed algorithms to detect a pedestrian and identify its movement but automation industries still are in search of a robust, efficient, simple and more accurate systems to achieve the desired goal. In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) a technique in deep learning, which is a subset of machine learning, has proved its stance in the field of artificial intelligence. CNN has successfully shown better accuracy and reliability performance than any other techniques used for similar tasks in computer vision. The paper present a system that recognizes a pedestrian moving in a particular direction using Convolutional Neural Networks. By thoroughly studying, understanding and augmenting stage-wise analysis method this paper proposes an innovative thought process that helps achieve better precision as compared to legacy techniques that involve more computational time. In this paper, CNN is used to train and classify binary as well as categorical pedestrian data. Pedestrian walking from left to right and vice versa are the two categories that are considered for binary classification. The accuracy observed for binary classification was 98.10%. This binary class became multiclass by adding two more categories of pedestrian carrying a belonging and walking from left to right and viceversa. The accuracy observed for these four categories was 87.07% for four class data.""",,"""S. Deokar; S.

In India, we thank the government for performing its outperformed active measures and spontaneous compliance to follow the policy of wearing masks when moving out to any public places; it entails active real-time monitoring to supervise the citizens by governments. In this process, real-time face-mask identification is a very challenging task of computer vision. And the absence of accurate datasets for this problem is a critical hard problem to solve. To address this bottleneck, we are proposing our real-time deep learning face-mask identification technique with annotated class labels with bounding boxes which have its real-time application to assist the governments to control and prevent the spread of these epidemics in its supervision. Our model is very robust and effective to classify the real-time images and videos for face mask detection with accuracy and average precision.

"""A belief rule-based expert system to diagnose influenza""","""Influenza is a viral disease that usually affects the nose, throat, bronchi, and seldom lungs. This disease spreads as seasonal epidemics around the world, with an annual attack rate of estimated at 5%-10% in adults and 20%-30% in children. Thus, influenza is regarded as one of the critical health hazards of the world. Early diagnosis (consisting of determination of signs and symptoms) of this disease can lessen its severity significantly. Examples of signs and symptoms of this disease consist of cough, fever, headache, bireme, nasal congestion, nasal polyps and sinusitis. These signs and symptoms cannot be measured with near-100% certainty due to varying degrees of uncertainties such as vagueness, imprecision, randomness, ignorance, and incompleteness. Consequently, traditional diagnosis, carried out by a physician, is unable to deliver desired accuracy. Hence, this paper presents the design, development and application of an expert system to diagnose influenza under uncertainty. The recently developed generic belief rule-based inference methodology by using the evidential reasoning (RIMER) approach is employed to develop this expert system, termed as Belief Rule Based Expert System (BRBES). The RIMER approach can handle different types of uncertainties, both in knowledge representation, and in inference procedures. The knowledge-base of this system was constructed by using records of the real patient data along with in consultation with the Influenza specialists of Bangladesh.

"""Object-Oriented Analysis of Very High-Resolution QuickBird Data for Mega City Research in Delhi/India""","""The 21st century is the century of the cities and of urbanisation. Mega cities in rapidly urbanising regions are hot spots of demographic and socio-economic dynamics. Their rapid growth results in uncontrolled processes of fragmentation which counteracts governance and steering . Due to the high dynamics of mega cities, the traditional methods such as statistical and regional analyses or fieldwork are limited to capture the urban process. New monitoring and planning methodologies are therefore required to provide tools to simplify planning processes in complex urban structures. Remote sensing provides the opportunity to monitor spatial patterns of urban structures with high spatial and temporal resolution. Very high-resolution remote sensing data from the QuickBird satellite are used to identify urban structures and dynamics within Delhi/India. The paper presents a first semi-automated, object-based classification approach which allows the distinction of different settlement types within the urban area. The method was developed for a representative data set within a selected test site and afterwards transferred to the whole test site as well as to a second region to prove the transferability and general validity of the methodology. The research is focused on the identification of ""informal settlements"" since these represent those characteristic municipal areas which are subject to particularly high dynamics, population density as well as marginalization. The developed methodology allows the recognition of similar settlement types within the urban area. In turn this outcome is compared with a pixel-based classification result to get an idea about the limits of conventional pixel-based classification methods. One of the project aims is the critical assessment of methods and the development of analytical tools. According to this fact the classification results were embedded in a framework for the determination of different socio-economic attributes (e.g. population density) within a certain settlement. This assumption is evaluated - in combination with quantitative and qualitative socio-economic information from about 800 questionnaires emanate from two intense field campaigns - in regard to place- specific infrastructure deficits. In addition, the methodology developed was tested on its transferability and general application. For this purpose other test sites in the Delhi area characterized by similar settlement structures were selected. This is understood to be a first step to the development of indicators which will help to identify and understand the different forms, actors and processes of vulnerability in mega cities.""",,"""S.

"""Scalability of Data Mining Algorithms for Non-Stationary Data""","""Streaming data is increasing day-by-day in real world applications such as stock market, financial data etc. The prime quality of this data is the online advent and collection at high speed and vulnerability to transforms in the data distributions due to the dynamic environment. The biggest challenge of analyzing this data is the lack of unrestricted availability of non-stationary dataset for evaluation and comparison. Extracting useful information from non-stationary dataset is also challenging because of its scaling nature. In this paper, different classification techniques of data mining are applied for analyzing non-stationary dataset using different existing and proposed cascade scaling method. The approach begins with the collection of a real time dataset of National Stock Exchange of India NSEI from online Yahoo finance site, which is then pre-pro cessed. The novel approach of three rules has been applied to fix the binary target value based on the buy/sell of the shares on the particular day. Once the dataset has been pre-processed, it is decomposed into smaller datasets of equal size subsets. The particular data mining approach is then applied identically to each subset. The findings of the data mining approach on all subsets are pooled and aggregated for the final output. The performance of the suggested algorithm is assessed using a number of criteria, including accuracy, precision, recall, f-score, and execution time. The comparative analysis of the mentioned performance metrices are evaluated for the various data mining approaches. The next comparative analysis includes the non-scaling and proposed cascade scaling method for the various data mining approaches. Lastly, the performance comparison of existing scaling methods with proposed cascade scaling method for the accuracy parameter is evaluated where proposed method achieved substantial performance on the non-stationary dataset.""",,"""S.

"""Dual-Frequency GPS Derived Precipitable Water Vapor and Comparison with ERA-Interim Reanalysis Data Over Indian stations""","""Apart from positioning, velocity and time transfer applications, the Global Position System (GPS) offers an exceptional opportunity for probing the space weather as well as atmospheric weather as the signals traverse various layers of earth's atmosphere. Following ionosphere delay, the troposphere delay is regarded as a non-negligible propagation threat to GPS and other navigation system performances. Present paper focuses on estimating Precipitable Water Vapour (PWV) which along with the dry gas pressure is responsible for total zenith tropospheric delay (ZTD) in GPS positioning. GPS observables at seven different locations in and around Indian subcontinent are processed through GAMIT that involves phase double difference positioning solution along through modeling of the delay parameters. With additional observed/modeled temperature and pressure parameters, the zenith hydrostatic delay (ZHD), zenith wet delay (ZWD), and PWV are estimated. The GPS- PWV is further validated with the ERA-Interim reanalysis data for investigating the disparity over the region. We noticed an acceptable agreement between the two at Bangalore (towards the equator) followed by underestimation at Hyderabad and overestimation at the farthest location Lucknow, through straddling across the average minimum values is perceived at KLU- Guntur location in India. The interpretation from the observations motivates further analysis of the GPS-based water vapor parameter at diverse locations involving the tropical wet and dry climate over Hyderabad and Guntur, semi-arid climatic conditions over Bangalore, and humid-subtropical climate over Lucknow.

"""Landslide Suspectibility Mapping Using Hybrid Deep Learning""","""To put it simply, landslides are the collapse of a slope’s worth of land, posing a threat to human, animal, and man-made life under varying and often erratic climatic and lithological conditions. The development of cutting-edge space technology has allowed for the expansion of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry in the face of disaster. Copernicus Sentinel 1 SAR data products, with a temporal resolution of 12 days, are freely available, enriching periodic monitoring of the Earth’s surface. Over the course of several decades, differential SAR interferometry (DInSAR) techniques have been widely used for the purpose of tracking and identifying surface distortion. Over 105 landslides occurred in the Kodagu district of Karnataka during the 15th and 17th of August 2018. Before and after landslide occurrences, Sentinel-1 datasets acquired in Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) mode are utilised. Topographic and atmospheric inaccuracies have a significant impact on the displacement result derived from DInSAR. Due to its non-uniform accuracy variance, DEMs must be evaluated prior to being used for a variety of applications. DEMs and InSAR produced DEMs are evaluated with respect to their vertical and horizontal accuracy using Survey of India (SOI) toposheets as a standard of comparison. After considering their accuracy in both the vertical and horizontal planes, researchers have concluded that ALOS are the best option for topographic phase removal. Use of ALOS for InSAR analysis over the Kodagu district is recommended as it shows the least amount of error compared to other DEMs. Sentinel 1 can be utilised for assessment of larger landslides, and it is recommended to use corner reflectors to produce promising findings, according to a time series analysis done across the selected landslide regions using the Hybrid Deep Learning approach.""",,"""R.

"""Evaluation of configuration plans for DGs in developing countries using advanced planning techniques""","""Many developing countries have emphasis on distributed generation (DG) technology for their generation expansion planning. The planning considerations and judicious choice of attributes are dictated by prevailing conditions. The attributes considered are capital costs, energy not served per annum, and profits from injecting power into the grid at peak load, all of which are important for a developing country. The uncertain futures considered are three possible loading conditions, which can be low, medium and high. Different scenarios (plans) are generated by various combinations of configurations. DGs can be configured as stand-alone mode, hybrid operation, or micro-grid formation with or without grid connection. With the increased complexities in DG planning options along with the multiple attributes to be accounted, more sophisticated techniques other than conventional economic analysis are needed to arrive at correct decisions by decision makers. The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is used for obtaining relative weights in an objective way. Further, the statistical method like interval-based multi-attribute decision making with tradeoff analysis is used for shortlisting the feasible plans and identifying the most appropriate plan. It is proposed to use the weights obtained from AHP for finding the performance efficiencies in data envelopment analysis (DEA) for evaluating the plans. A new composite utility function is proposed to resolve cases where performance efficiency is insufficient for evaluation in DEA application.

"""A low cost wireless sensor network for water quality monitoring in natural water bodies""","""Water is one of the precious factors in human life. It plays a vital role in the survival and existence of flora and fauna. But, now a days it is been exploited heavily by dumping of human waste, industrial and chemical waste in to the water bodies which is the resultant of water being contaminated with toxic chemicals. Water scarcity and water contamination has been one of the major issues faced by the society around the world. In many developing countries like India, the main focus is given to industrialization and urbanization. But this has caused an increased water usage and water contamination. This paper deals with the monitoring of water quality by mainly considering the physical and chemical properties of water. For this purpose, a Wireless Sensor node is designed which will contain several sensors to sense the chemical contents of water. The highlight of sensor node is that it is water proof. The main components of WSN include microcontroller for processing the system, communication system for inter and intra node communication and several sensors. The power for the sensor nodes are obtained from the solar panels connected to the sensor nodes. Though, in earlier times, there were water quality monitoring systems, they were power hungry and not real time. Apart from acting as a single system, if this system integrates with other innovative solutions like Smart Home or Smart Building, the application of this system would increase leading to an increased demand for it.

"""Change Detection in Image Time-Series Using Unsupervised LSTM""","""Deep learning-based unsupervised change detection (CD) methods compare a prechange and a postchange image in deep feature space and require precise knowledge of the event date for selecting proper pre-/post-change images. However, in many applications changes may occur gradually over a span of time making pre-/post-dates difficult to establish or prior knowledge of event date is unknown. On the other hand, deep learning-based time-series analysis methods are generally supervised. Considering such scenarios, we propose a novel unsupervised deep learning-based method to detect changes in an image time-series. The method does not make any assumption on the date of the occurrence of the change event. It treats CD as an anomaly detection problem by exploiting multilayer long short term memory (LSTM) network to learn a representation of the time series. The proposed method ingests a shuffled time series and uses an encoder–decoder LSTM model to rearrange the input sequence in correct order. While the model fails to rearrange the changed pixels, unchanged data can be rearranged in the correct order. This enables the identification of the changed pixels. To show the effectiveness of the proposed method, we tested it on two multitemporal Sentinel-1 data sets over Brumadinho, Brazil, and Bhavanisagar, India.""",,"""S. Saha; F. Bovolo; L.

"""Performance assessment on expanding SBAS service areas of GAGAN and MSAS to Singapore region""","""In past decade, the GPS plays an important role in many navigation applications. In some cases, the GPS is the only device providing navigation service. For safety-of-life user, GPS alone cannot provide the stringent performance in accuracy, integrity and availability. As a result, several SBAS (Satellite Based Augmentation System) systems have been developed to provide corrections and assistances to GPS users. The notably SBAS systems are U.S. WAAS (Wide Area Augmentation System), Europe EGNOS (European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service) and Japanese MSAS (Multi-functional Satellite Augmentation System), In addition, India and Russia have engaged in the deployment and development of SBAS system, named GAGAN (GPS Aided Geo Augmented Navigation) and SDCM (System of Differential Correction and Monitoring). Also, other regions in the world currently proceed feasibility studies on SBAS. For instance, SACCSA (The Augmentation Solution for the Caribbean, Central America and South America) project in Latin-America, ASAS (African Satellite Augmentation System) in Africa and Malaysian SBAS. SBAS broadcast the correction for ionosphere delay and satellite clock. By using these corrections, the user position accuracy can improve to several meters or better. In Singapore, Changi airport is one of busiest airport in the world, and it handled more than fifty million passengers in 2012. Additionally, Singapore is located in the equatorial region so that the ionosphere activities are dramatic. Currently, there is no SBAS service in the Singapore region. The objective of this paper is to propose a fusion scheme to exploit the correction and integrity monitoring messages from nearby two SBAS systems, GAGAN and MSAS and then provide a reliable correction for GPS users. Singapore is not located in the service volume of either GAGAN or MSAS. Because of the lack of SBAS monitoring stations, the navigation quality in Singapore region cannot be assured through either GAGAN or MSAS. The messages from both SBAS systems can be still received. Therefore, it is desired to investigate how messages from GAGAN and MSAS can be utilized to enhance the performance for GPS user. Then, its goal is to ensure a smooth transition and assured navigation performance in this region. In the paper, both GAGAN and MSAS messages are firstly received and analyzed for the assessment of the signal quality. And then, a comparison with the requirements at different phases of flight is made. A synergistic integration of the messages from by GAGAN and MSAS in Singapore is developed to pave a way for the future regional augmentation system implementation. An extrapolation scheme is proposed to expand the coverage of ionospheric delay correction messages from GAGAN and MSAS. All proposed fusion and extrapolation schemes are assessed by using real data to evaluate performance. The result shows that our approach has reliable performance compared to a surveying-grade receiver.""",,"""Y. -F. Tsai; K. -S.

"""A Review of Collaborated Educational Drone Development and Design at the BRICS 2018 Future Skills Challenge""","""Unmanned aerial vehicles, remote piloted aircraft systems, or drones, have the ability to enable autonomy in manufacturing environments through self-charging and maintenance diagnostics. Drone development for manufacturing application was exploited in the BRICS 2018 (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) Future Skills Challenge. The challenge was completed over a period of three (3) days and five (5) teams participated in designing and manufacturing unique drones and self-charging stations. Quadcopters and base stations were designed and developed for manual flight and self-charging for autonomous production environments. The paper discussed design elements in terms of mechanical design, mechatronic design, flight control optimisation and drone performance criteria. The drones were evaluated according to work organisation and management, manufacturing and assembly principles, programming and testing standards, and commissioning performance criteria. The results of each design group from the evaluation were compared and discussed accordingly. The evaluation was done through subjective visual inspections for quality and could potentially misinterpret the results of the assessment. A technical evaluation approach is recommended to evaluate drone performance, utilising in-flight measuring instruments for repeatability and stable flight.""",,"""C. I. Basson; S. Hansraj; R.

"""A Decision-Making Model With Intuitionistic Fuzzy Information for Selection of Enterprise Resource Planning Systems""","""Involvement of small and medium-scale enterprises is important for developing countries like India. Henceforth, enhancing their competency with the adoption of a suitable enterprise resource planning system (ERPS) is a vital way to enhance their competitiveness. The choice of an appropriate ERPS can be considered as a complex multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) problem where several alternatives (ERPS packages) are assessed based on certain types of characteristics, namely domain knowledge of the supplier, system reliability, service and support, functionality, compatibility, information security, cross-module integration, etc. One critical issue associated with the evaluation of ERPSs is the handling of uncertain information. In this article, we first develop a new methodology to resolve the issue of MCDM problems. In this methodology, the weights of decision experts are systematically calculated with the extended variance approach on intuitionistic fuzzy sets. For calculating the criteria weights, an optimization model based on cross-entropy is proposed, and for the aggregation of the criteria values, a new model called intuitionistic fuzzy improved measurement alternatives and ranking based on the compromise solution is developed, which allows both the vector and linear normalizations and having the advantages of comprising two kinds of aggregation models. Next, an ERPS cloud vendor assessment problem is deliberated with three alternatives (A1: Systems, Applications, and Products (SAP), A2: Oracle Corporation, A3: Microsoft Corporation) and 16 criteria to interpret the reasonableness of the introduced framework. According to the outcomes, SAP is the most suitable alternative. Next, a sensitivity analysis is exhibited with diverse parameter values to inspect the permanence of the presented approach. The advantage of the presented approach is discussed with the comparative investigation.""",,"""P. P. Deb; D. Bhattacharya; I. Chatterjee; A. Saha; A. R. Mishra; S. H.

"""Forefront Planning, Monitoring, Operation, and Maintenance Procedure for Solar Power System in India""","""This paper summarizes the forefront planning, monitoring, operation, and maintenance of solar PV and utility-scale systems. Photovoltaic (PV) systems' operation and maintenance are becoming a crucial and high-worth activity to meet future energy requirements. The current changes in power systems, including Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) with an increasing need for flexibility of planning, operations, and energy storage, affect consumers in one way or another. Therefore, enhancing grid reliability, resiliency, and security of the system with the new technology of generation integrating with the existing grid need to address. Energy Management System (EMS) applications involve planning software to leverage each other’s strengths. One should focus on the bankability of renewable energy projects, which has been an issue in India due to the inability to consume power and pay for it. The high consumer expectations and demands on the grid due to constant load growth and the penetration of new technologies, particularly solar energy, on the existing electrical systems, are among the serious issues which need to crack.

"""Profiling user behaviour for efficient and resilient cloud management""","""User behaviour profiling can be used within network management schemes to indicate the capabilities required from management proxies in terms of the way(s) and rate at which they should be aware of real-time network state and change in resource demands/requirements. A management proxy in a cloud, for example, needs ability to monitor change in the most popular webpages associated with a website or files associated with an application so that this detail may influence the caching strategy for optimised performance and operation. When resources are provisioned dynamically across a cloud, the strategy to do so will accommodate efficiency and security objectives, and also take into account the ways in which users are demanding services to optimise the opportunities that their requirements are met. Many online companies now operate in this way and analyse customer behaviour to improve services by meeting predictable requirements and utilising unpredictable behaviour. It is therefore to this gap we respond in this work. A network management model is developed around behaviour profiles of user activities associated with the Wireless Sensor Knowledge Archive (Wisekar) website hosted in the Indian Institute of Technology in Delhi, India. Trends in user access and activities with the website are identified and, in response, a management framework is proposed. A Certainty Factor quantifies the confidence with which management is applied such that actions enforced accommodate both predictable and unpredictable user behaviour.""",,"""C. Peoples; G. Parr; B.

"""Enhancing software quality through systematic object mapping""","""Indian Software industries are uniquely placed world over as the software solution providers due to the advantage of high calibre, good English speaking technical manpower employers. The companies enjoy a trusted status among the western companies. However India is still lacking in becoming a world leader in providing quality software solution. The software industries demonstrate compliance to specific western standards implying a mere follower rather than a leader. Countries in the South East Asia, Eastern Europe and also South America pose serious threat to Indian Companies from becoming world leaders. Opinions are floating that most serious development cannot be carried out in India owing to less than mature Quality levels of both the outsourced as well as original software. The basic strategy to demonstrate software quality is to reduce the frequency of the defects and issues and evolving mitigating methods to weaken the severity experienced by the users. In this paper an attempt is made to improve the software quality by mapping the relational objects of the software. Functional defect data was gathered for an application Software and categorised into High, Medium and Low type of defects with underlying need for urgent attention of High category ones. The number of defects generated through test cases for each object (module) is normalised and treated to form relational clusters. Dendrogram is drawn and cluster members are arrived. Ward method of maxima and minima tabulated for each of the category of defects and the mean is found. Defects by test cases is found and graded as needing primary attention to that of less significant ones. Modules contributing to the highest defect density is identified and listed. These defects are systematically analysed and root causes identified. By placing the best mitigating practices the Software Quality can be enhanced.""",,"""R. Muthukumar; D.

"""Talent acquisition & transformation — A new paradigm""","""Summary form only given. IT-BPM industry has received global recognition as the growth engine for India and the sectors it services across the world. It has established itself as a pioneer with the range of services it offers, the global customer base it serves and the numerous employment opportunities it provides to the workforce in India. As per NASSCOM's Strategic Review 2013, the industry aggregated revenues exceed $ 110 billion and employs more than 3 million people. The industry accounts for almost 25 percent of the total exports and 11 percent of the total service revenues. In order to drive the acquisition of right talent and to ensure the development of an employable workforce for the industry, IT-ITeS Sector Skills Council NASSCOM (SSC NASSCOM) has taken up an initiative to carry out an Occupational Analysis and Mapping of unique job roles in the industry. Subsequently a functional analysis exercise has helped develop Occupational Standards (OS) for all Entry Level job roles in the IT-BPM Industry. Developed in close association with key member companies in the IT-BPM industry; these standards in the long term will provide a foundation for ensuring quality in the talent pipeline. The initial step was the conduct of `Occupational Analysis & Mapping', which entails an industry scan and a process of identifying different occupations in the various sub-sectors. It describes the main features and characteristics of an occupation, within the IT-BPM industry, specifically the IT Services sub-sector. It provides a high-level overview of an occupation in the sub-sector in terms of the types of job roles that exist, workforce characteristics, key talent trends, and a review of the available education and training. `Occupational Analysis' therefore provides information on opportunities that exist for progression through a career in a specific occupation. The Occupational Analysis reports help define Occupational Standards for unique Entry level job roles /qualification packs. The emerging trends and applications in Computer Science with reference to employment opportunities shall be showcased at this conference with special focus on the IT Services sub-sector within the IT-BPM industry. The presentation will also encompass aspects of talent acquisition and transformation that will be positively impacted by standardization and globalization. Globalization as on ongoing trend will continue to change the nature of jobs, technology and the mobility of the workforce. It is therefore necessary that we have a proposition that has a recognizable and usable currency no matter where it is applied. SSC NASSCOM has made a remarkable endeavor to create a common skills currency between its members and for this industry sector, a recognizable means of global exchange of skills via unique job roles/qualification packs. From a workforce development perspective these new industry standards cover knowledge, competence and proficiency. These standards offer all stakeholders related to this industry sector the clarity regarding the knowledge, skills and competencies necessary to perform a function /job. By providing easily accessible standards it helps individuals, firms, training and official agencies understand what functions/jobs are required in order to perform in a particular occupation. The specifications articulated in job role /qualification pack also underpins behaviors that are essential if a job /function is to be carried out in a productive and creative way. In conclusion the occupational analysis & mapping has identified job related competency standards that would, set a benchmark and help develop a common-currency, that will make the workforce function more efficient, provide employment opportunities, increase productivity, create wealth and foster the security of our country and out planet at large.""",,"""S.

"""Modeling and Control of Power Electronics Converter System for Power-Quality Improvements [Book News]""","""The book is authored by an industrial-academic team. Sanjeet Kumar Dwivedi is from Danfoss Power Electronics A/S, Grasten, Denmark, and the other coauthors are academic teachers of electrical engineering departments from three different universities in India. As a result, the text provides required knowledge for the modeling, analysis, and control of different converter topologies in power-quality improvement without unnecessary theoretical ballast. The book consists of six chapters and two appendices. Each chapter includes a list of references and further reading. A glossary and index are added at the end of the book. The first four chapters create the introductory basis, and the final two present examples of practical solutions with design, simulation, experimental building, and testing. Among the book’s strengths is that it includes modeling and control methods for different ac– dc converter topologies used in the active improvement of power quality. It also facilitates understanding using real parameters for simulations in MATLAB and PSIM programs as well as experimental tests to show the efficacy of grid current harmonics reduction according to valid standards. One of its weaknesses is that the text is based on a slightly outdated list of references. I recommend this book as useful text for students and scholars who work in the area of power-quality improvement using power electronic converters and are interested in design and modeling.
