# Dataset-for-the-SLR-in-mobile-app-security

In our Systematic Literature Review (SLR), we systematically conducted searches in various repositories, utilizing a search string based on titles and abstracts of publications. 
The results obtained after this step are presented in the "**Initial publications collected**" folder.

Following these results, we meticulously eliminated duplicate publications, ensuring that only one instance with an identical title, abstract, author name, and year of publication was retained. Subsequently, we excluded books and thesis reports from our dataset. The results obtained are in the **Publication_after_merging.csv** file.

A comprehensive manual review of the titles and abstracts of the remaining articles was then undertaken to refine our dataset further. 
 
The dataset presented by the **Publication_after_screening.csv** file represents the result of these sequential steps. It includes final papers that have been selected, as well as others that we'll be removing in a later stage. We have incorporated additional columns in this dataset to facilitate our selection process. Specifically, the "Mobile App Related (MAR)" column designates studies related to mobile apps, while the "Security is the Main Focus (SITMF)" column indicates studies primarily centered around security. Moreover, the "Security is Only Mentioned" column signifies studies where security is mentioned but is not the main focus, and the "User Study" column denotes studies that involve user-focused research. 
We have labeled publications in each column with either "Yes" or "No". Given our specific interest in mobile app security, our selection criteria prioritize works that delve into mobile apps (MAR) and concurrently discuss security, irrespective of whether security is the primary focus or merely mentioned. The "Chosen" column designates the publications meeting these criteria, and entries marked with "Yes" in this column represent the selected works. For a detailed view of our chosen publications, please refer to the instances where "Yes" is indicated in the "Chosen" column.
