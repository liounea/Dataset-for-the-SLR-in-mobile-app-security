However, the awareness about these scams and ways to avoid them remains limited among mobile users. We present a qualitative analysis of the dynamics of mobile-based fraud (specifically, SMS and call-based fraud) in Pakistan. We interviewed 96 participants, including different stakeholders in the mobile financial ecosystem: 71 victims of mobile-based scams, seven non-victims, 15 mobile money agents, and three officials from regulatory agencies that investigate mobile-based fraud. Leveraging the perspectives from these stakeholders and analyzing mobile-based fraud with a four-step social-engineering attack framework, we make four concrete contributions: First, we identify the nuances as well as specific tactics, methods, and resources that fraudsters use to scam mobile users. Second, we look at other actors, beyond the victim and the adversary, involved or affected by fraud and their roles at each step of the fraud process. Third, we discuss victims' understanding of mobile fraud, their behavior post-realization, and their attitudes toward reporting fraud. Finally, we discuss possible points of intervention and offer design recommendations to thwart mobile fraud, including addressing the vulnerabilities discovered in the ecosystem, utilizing existing actors to mitigate the consequences of these attacks, and realigning the design of fraud reporting mechanisms with the sociocultural practices.""""","","""""Razaq L,Ahmad T,Ibtasam S,Ramzan U,Mare S""""","2021","10.1145/3449115","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3449115","Journal Article"

The cash economy had the unintended consequence of excluding a large portion of the population from financial services, particularly banking services. This shift is significant for the economy because it has enabled the informal sector to tap into banking services. The Zimbabwean informal sector has gradually emerged as a major employer owing to economic challenges that have shrunk the formal sector. This reality has motivated mobile telephony companies to introduce innovative financial products targeting this sector. In this paper we use the SWOT framework to analyse the mobile banking sector in Zimbabwe. Our investigation seeks to inform stakeholders about the sector's potential and to caution about weaknesses that impact on stability and growth.

MSET claims to be a promising protocol for mobile payment. However, we have observed certain flaws and drawbacks in the proposed protocol. In this paper we discuss those flaws and drawbacks and propose counter measures for the same to ensure secure transaction. The first flaw is that a dishonest client can buy goods from a merchant without paying the actual price of the goods. We also observed that the MSET protocol lacks the Non-Repudiation property of transaction. Further, we would like to mention that the modified SET is using certificate, which is having no use once the symmetric key is distributed. This causes communication overhead for the mobile application. As a result the protocol will be useful only for mobiles with reasonably high processing power. With the growing demand of mobile based payment systems in developing countries this could be a disadvantage.""""","","""""D. M.

The system supports payment transactions by utilising mobile phones applications. However, the acceptance of JoMoPay system in Jordan is still below the level of expectation. This study was undertaken to understand and explain the acceptance of JoMoPay system based on extending the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) model in the Jordanian context. The model was extended by considering two additional constructs namely; security and privacy. Utilising a self-reported survey, collected data was analysed using structural equation modelling (SEM) to test the research model. Five constructs were found to be the determinants of behavioural intention to use JoMoPay system, namely performance expectancy, social influence, price value, security and privacy. Together they account for 61.4% of the variance in behavioural intention. However, effort expectancy, facilitating condition and hedonic motivation did not have a significant impact on behavioural intention to use JoMoPay system and hence the related hypotheses were not supported. Lastly, conclusions, limitations and future research directions will be discussed further in the last section of the paper.""""","","""""Al-Okaily M,Rahman MS,Ali A,Abu-Shanab E,Masa'deh R""""","2023","10.1504/ijbis.2023.128306","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1504/ijbis.2023.128306","Journal Article"

Projections show transaction values will exceed  $\$ $ 3 billion by the end of 2022, and Sub-Saharan Africa contributes half of the daily transactions. SMS (Short Message Service) phishing cost corporations and individuals millions of dollars annually. Spammers use Smishing (SMS Phishing) messages to trick a mobile money user into sending electronic cash to an unintended mobile wallet. Though Smishing is an incarnation of phishing, they differ in the information available and attack strategy. As a result, detecting Smishing becomes difficult. Numerous models and techniques to detect Smishing attacks have been introduced for high-resource languages, yet few target low-resource languages such as Swahili. This study proposes a machine-learning based model to classify Swahili Smishing text messages targeting mobile money users. Experimental results show a hybrid model of Extratree classifier feature selection and Random Forest using TFIDF (Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization yields the best model with an accuracy score of 99.86%. Results are measured against a baseline Multinomial Naïve-Bayes model. In addition, comparison with a set of other classic classifiers is also done. The model returns the lowest false positive and false negative of 2 and 4, respectively, with a Log-Loss of 0.04.

Because of the low cost of COTS sUAS and the prior success of these uses, this trend is increasing at an alarming rate, leading to the need to counter the malicious usage of sUAS (i.e., rogue sUAS). Researchers, the armed forces, and technologists have all proposed disparate solutions to this problem. There are no comprehensive and compact solutions capable of effectively tracking, identifying, and actively neutralizing the threats associated with rogue sUAS. Thus, we have developed a mobile cyber solution, using rigorous penetration testing across the top sUAS COTS vendors. Based on the market share of these top vendors, our approach is applicable to approximately 90% of all COTS sUAS. We demonstrate that hard-to-patch vulnerabilities (i.e., vulnerabilities that exist across all the top vendors of sUAS) can be used as back-doors to counter the threat of rouge sUAS. Our solution can be launched from a standard laptop or Android mobile device with an external antenna, and is capable of tracking, identifying, and disrupting all Parrot and 3DR sUAS, as well as almost all DJI sUAS (i.e., renders them incapable of video flight) within a 300-meter radius.""""","","""""Watkins L,Ramos J,Snow G,Vallejo J,Robinson WH,Rubin AD,Ciocco J,Jedrzejewski F,Liu J,Li C""""","2018","10.1145/3215466.3215467","https://doi-org.proxy.bnl.lu/10.1145/3215466.3215467","Conference Paper"

This study conducts a forensic investigation of twelve popular Android m-banking apps in Nigeria to determine if the generated backups by the mobile OS do not save sensitive data; the application removes sensitive data from view when backgrounded; sensitive data are not held longer than necessary in the memory, with the memory cleared after use; minimum device access security policies are enforced by the app, and users are educated by the app about the type of PII processed and security best practices in using the app. Our findings revealed that while none of the apps saved sensitive data in generated backup, all except one held data of sensitive value in the memory of the test device and did not enforce any device access security policy. Also, none of the apps removed sensitive data when backgrounded. In addition to serving as a source of information for forensic investigators, we believe our study could assist mobile banking app developers in identifying aspects of the development process that need attention, which would lead to better secured apps.""""","Yes","""""Oluwafemi Osho; Uthman L.

That's why banks need a system to evaluate the safety of their mobile banking services. The cyber-security barriers to mobile banking encountered by SACCOs in Kenya were identified using a survey study methodology, and the strategies used by SACCOs to mitigate the effects of these problems on the supply of mobile banking services were assessed. The research uncovered the risks associated with mobile banking in terms of cyber security. This analysis also assessed the measures taken by SACCOs to guarantee the provision of a safe mobile banking service in the eyes of their customers. The results informed the development of a framework for the provision of mobile banking services that prioritizes customers' sense of safety.

The discussion deals primarily with the extent a mobile phone service provider and/or or messaging applications provider and/or manufacturer must assist a law enforcement agency in gaining access to mobile data, specifically where the data is encrypted and/or password protected. It should be established whether a mobile phone service and/or applications provider and/or manufacturer must design security and/or privacy measures in such a way that law enforcement may gain access to the encrypted data. It may be argued that national security interests regarding the investigation of serious crimes such as kidnapping, child pornography, corruption and terrorism outweigh user privacy and user security. Terrorism affects all countries globally and in many instances result in the indiscriminate killing of a large number of people as illustrated by the Paris November 2015, the US December 2015, Abidjan, Ivory Coast, Brussels and Pakistan March 2016 killings. Although a law enforcement agency is pressurized to gather as much as possible evidence to investigate such heinous acts and prevent future attacks, the mobile phone evidence must be gathered within a legal framework that provides checks and balances to prevent the development of a police state resulting in the erosion or elimination of human rights. It is necessary to debate whether banning encryption and/or compelling a provider to have the technology to decrypt encrypted mobile communications or override password protected mobile data would serve as an investigative solution in the interest of national security or whether it would ultimately result in weakening user security and privacy to such an extent that all users around the world would be vulnerable to unlawful intrusions.""""","","""""M.

To support this argument, we diagnose the problems from two directions: (1) a large-scale analysis of existing financial service products and (2) a series of interviews with 7 developers and designers in Africa and South America. We frame this assessment within a novel, systematic threat model. In our large-scale analysis, we evaluate 197 Android apps and take a deeper look at 71 products to assess specific organizational practices.

One of the key reasons behind this is the fact that a lot of areas in the developing world suffer from technological impediments that are a result of poor infrastructure, low literacy, intermittent power connectivity, and unstable bandwidth connectivity. In technological resource constrained environments such as these, deploying standard PHR systems is challenging and so it makes sense to redesign these systems to cope with the environmental limitations in order to offer users a usable and reliable platform. Furthermore, healthcare data is inherently privacy and security sensitive so, in re-designing the PHR system the security and privacy requirements need also be taken into consideration. The idea in this case, is to opt for security mechanisms that offer the same levels of security as is the case in the standard PHR systems that are used in the developed world, but that are also lightweight in terms of performance and storage overhead.

The usage of mobile phones is pretty ordinary in this present era. Mobile phones have become an inseparable friend for many users, serving much more than just communication tools. Every subsequent person is heavily relying on them due to multifaceted usage and affordability. Every person wants to manage his/her daily transactions and related issues by using his/her mobile phone. With the rise and advancements of mobile-specific security, threats are evolving as well. In this paper, we provide a survey of various security models for mobile phones. We explore multiple proposed models of the mobile payment system (MPS), their technologies and comparisons, payment methods, different security mechanisms involved in MPS, and provide analysis of the encryption technologies, authentication methods, and firewall in MPS. We also identify current challenges and future directions of mobile phone security.""""","","""""W. Ahmed; A. Rasool; A. R. Javed; N. Kumar; T. R. Gadekallu; Z. Jalil; N.

At the same time, blockchain-based cryptocurrency is becoming a nonnegligible type of currency and the total value of all types of cryptocurrency has reached USD 200 billion. Therefore, it is a natural demand to support cryptocurrency payment on mobile devices. Considering the poor infrastructure and low penetration of financial service in developing countries, this combination is especially attractive. The high storage cost and payment processing latency are the two main obstacles for mobile payment using cryptocurrency. We propose two different schemes for cryptocurrency mobile payment, one involves a centralized bank and the other one does not require any centralized party. We also provide a solution for the bank to meet KYC (know your customer)/AML (antimoney laundering) compliance requirements when it is involved in cryptocurrency mobile payment processing.""""","","""""L.

Inside of these markets, competitors have appeared who leverage ThinSIMS, small SIM-card add-ons, to provide alternative mobile money implementations. However, the security implications of ThinSIMs are not well understood.To resolve this, we explore the security of phone-based mobile money systems against attacks via the SIM interface, the 3GPP-defined interface between a SIM card and a phone. Using a ThinSIM to intercept and initiate communication over the SIM interface, we demonstrate that a malicious ThinSIM can steal a user's mPesa credentials and initiate transactions without the user's consent or knowledge. We also demonstrate a similar ThinSIM-based attack against USSD-based mobile money systems that allows for similar transactions without the user's knowledge or participation.

The first solution launched in Kenya in 2007, M-PESA is one of the world major mobile money services. Mobile money becomes the new monopoly of MMOs in an economic system where the rate of unbanked adults is very high. Currently in 2019 Orange Money makes nearly 1.5 million transactions per day, which corresponds to a monetary value of nearly 15 billion CFA francs per day. The USSD is the technology at the heart of the Mobile-money transactions. Blockchain, which is the underlying technology of the first crypto currency Bitcoin, has drawn a lot of global attention in recent years. Blockchain does not stop seeing its field of action widen. The field of action of the Blockchain has not yet completed its enlargement. The rate of unbanked is still very high in developing countries; this rate is a factor that does not favor the emergence of the economy. It is necessary to count on the mobile money to skip this obstacle (according to the World Bank) we make here the state of the art on the mobile money and its underlying technologies in the sub-Saharan countries and in Burkina-Faso.

This multiple case study in three public hospitals in South Africa and Namibia describes factors driving the enactment of workarounds to the Vula mobile referral application. An interpretive paradigm was taken and semi-structured interviews conducted with 29 HCPs were analysed using a thematic analysis approach. Substantial evidence is found indicating misfits between work and use of referral applications in public hospitals. A conceptual framework is developed to explain workaround practices based on emerging concepts. The study finds that there is misfit between work and use e-referral applications in public hospitals. As a result, HCPs are enacting workarounds in a form of 1) Shadow IT (Information technology), 2) Augmenting existing systems by using alternative computer-based, telephonic and paper-based referrals 3) Fitting by adapting the e-referral application to accommodate misfits with work activities. These practices suggest a design-reality gap in failing to accommodate these issues in the e-referral application design. Additionally, these practices have brought severe security risks to clinical information used on shadow systems, compromising the privacy and confidentiality of patient information. Public health institutions therefore need to develop more effective measures, policies, and strategies to address unresolved constraints in the referral system.""""","","""""Meke I.

This is due to the ease and speed in which they disburse small loans to users, compared to traditional financial institutions, such as banks, that only offer similar loans based on existing customer relationship or collateral. As mobile loan apps are a relatively new industry, these apps are mostly unregulated and therefore tend to charge extremely high interest rates. Further, they collect and sometimes misuse sensitive user data through the course of verifying customers and ensuring loan repayment, such as users’ contacts and SMS communications through the mobile device permission system. Yet, the reasons for usage as well as privacy concerns with these mobile loan apps in the developing world, and specifically in Kenya, remain largely unexplored. To investigate mobile loan apps, we conducted semi-structured interviews (n = 20) with loan app users in Kenya, and we find that most users generally have privacy concerns, particularly regarding access to their phones’ contacts. However, they often overlook these concerns as this outweighs their need to procure loans. At the same time, we find that users struggle to understand the use of permissions by these mobile loan apps (and mobile apps generally), confirming prior research on comprehension of Android permissions. Our results highlight privacy risks, concerns and behavior with the emerging mobile loan app marketplace in the developing world, and we offer recommendations that can help protect their users’ security and privacy, including the need for transparent communication by these apps on how they collect, use and secure their users’ data.""""","Yes","""""C.

Contact tracing applications are technological solutions that can quickly trace and notify users of their potential exposure to the Covid-19 virus and help contain the spread of the disease. However, extant research delineating the various factors predicting the adoption of contact tracing apps is scant. The study's primary objective is to develop and validate a research model based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), health belief model (HBM), perceived privacy risk and perceived security risk to understand the adoption of contact tracing application.
Methods
An online survey was carried out among users of the ‘Aarogya Setu’ contact tracing app in India. The partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) tool was employed to analyze data from 307 respondents.
Results
The results showed that performance expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions positively influenced users’ intention to adopt the app. In contrast, perceived privacy and security risks were significant barriers to app adoption. Perceived disease threat as a moderator mitigated the adverse impact of perceived privacy risk on users' intention to adopt contact tracing apps.
Conclusions
The current study gives insights on both drivers and barriers to the adoption of contract tracing applications.

Digital contact tracing (DCT) was touted as an effective alternative to lockdown and other restrictive measures in controlling the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite considerable investments in research and development, the usage of DCT apps was found to be phenomenally low across the world. In this context, the current study investigates the factors influencing citizens’ continuance intentions to use the DCT app.
Methods
A theoretical framework was developed by extending the Expectation-confirmation model (ECM) of Information system continuance with Technology trust theory and a contextual factor perceived security and privacy to predict citizens’ continuance intentions to use the DCT app. The model was empirically tested using data from a field survey of 206 actual users of a DCT app implemented in India.
Results
The findings reveal that user satisfaction, trust in government, and trust in technology are significant predictors of citizens’ continuance intention. The model demonstrates high explanatory power by explaining 57.8% of the variance of continuance intention. It also validates the role of perceived security and privacy and trust in technology in determining user satisfaction.
Conclusion
The study makes a theoretical contribution by extending the ECM framework to predict DCT app continuance behavior.

We have completed the work with 310 responses via a survey on how many government app users there are in Bangladesh and why they are reluctant to use the app. Our data collection target was vast but we could not collect more than 310 because the maximum number of people in Bangladesh do not use government apps. In survey analysis, we have learned that people in Bangladesh are not interested in using government apps due to insecurity, simplicity, bugs, UI UX design and reliability issues. Based on our results, the use of these apps will increase if the government can develop apps based on the key points that have been highlighted. In the future, we will use machine learning and deep learning to find out the rate of users’ willingness to use apps, unwillingness, design, bugs, security, etc. As well as ways to increase the use of apps.""""","Yes","""""S.

These applications differ significantly from desktop and web applications, and being used increasingly in various enterprise domains. Accordingly, this motivates the mobile industries to increase the accessibility of mobile applications and their development across many platforms, including Android and iPhone. This research work discusses the security testing procedure and features of India's first indigenous AppStore “mSeva AppStore”. To ensure the quality of the hosted mobile applications, distinct techniques, and effective testing approaches are required. Before hosting the application on mSeva AppStore regressive testing is performed in all aspects like insecure permissions, data storage, secure logic, proper platform algorithms, etc. However, in the current mobile application testing scenario, other AppStore does not consider all factors before hosting the applications, which is quite necessary. This study highlights the key terminologies of mobile application testing and quality parameters. Further, demonstrates the actual results that are obtained during the security testing of various applications. Along with this, the first-ever Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) based classification regarding common artifacts in mobile application testing is provided.

UPI is based on the concept of 1 click 2-factor authentication. The first factor is the user’s mobile phone itself, and the second factor is MPIN or bio-metrics. It is based on the IMPS(Immediate Payment Service), but there are considerable differences between both services, and we will observe it. With a foresight to make the Indian economy cashless, it helps people transfer funds in an immediate and real-time process. It has played a major role in the revolution of cashless transactions in India. Although significant UPI users are minor and much lesser compared to the Indian population, over 2.07 billion transactions per month have been made by UPI by October 2020, which makes it our essential part of our day-to-day life. This paper will discuss the working of UPI, how UPI is different from conventional cashless transaction methods. After that, we will discuss how the attacker can find the UPI’s loopholes (here we reviewed UPI BHIM 1.0) and empty the victim’s bank account. The attacker can make these attacks remotely, and these attacks can affect a single user to multiple users. We will also discuss how the attacker can achieve his/her goal using a malicious App. In the end, we will see how UPI BHIM 2.0 update was successful in covering this security loophole.""""","Yes","""""Y.

With the rising technology, Fintech has become a modern phenomenon. Financial organizations deal with highly confidential and sensitive information, including personal and financial data, all of which are the primary target of cybercriminals. Users and other stakeholders are massive in number, and many are not concerned about security, so they often find themselves as victims. The result of the study shows that from the perspective of Bangladesh, most of the attacks on the fintech industry are generated using ransomware and social engineering methods. It also shows that app-based Mobile Financial System (MFS) is the most affected sector in the financial system. The study provides a comprehensive framework, FinSec, which refers to the financial Security Framework to protect from cyber-attacks targeting any financial organization. It covers recommendations for regular end-users and anybody working in the financial sector. It also provides an architecture based on Consortium Blockchain, Hyper-ledger Fabric in a hybrid cloud to ensure a high level of security at the application level. Additionally, the framework proposes newer Three-Way Authentication (3WA) and Gamification to protect end-users. The research emphasizes ensuring a minimum level of training, as even after ensuring everything, massive damage can occur for the simplest mistake of the individuals related to the industry. To protect the financial system, from end-users to employees and user applications to the whole infrastructure, everything, and everyone should be secured. The framework hence recommends three subunits – Action, Knowledge, and Simulation Unit. These subunits protect the respective sector and, finally, end up protecting the fintech organizations.""""","","""""M. J. Hossain; R. H. Rifat; M. H. Mugdho; M. Jahan; A. A. Rasel; M. A.

E-health applications have gained wide acceptance among the doctor community because of their ability to help doctors in understanding the various pattern of symptoms that show up in the initial stages of a disease or during a relapse which in turn saves a lot of time and lives. These applications have also been used by a lot of patients to get instant access to their medical history which otherwise would have not have been possible with the traditional way of maintaining printed medical records in a file. Health records of a patient usually contain sensitive information and digitalization of these records will significantly increase the chances of private data falling into the wrong hands so it is very critical to provide secured access mechanisms to all the stakeholders present in this system and ensure users privacy. Medical data breach can be avoided by the implementation of various authentication and authorization techniques wherever necessary. Health care sector doesn't have a centralized way of identifying a patient and this decreases the feasibility of large scale storage and maintenance of the medical records provided by various doctors. Ever since the introduction of Aadhaar in India, all the major organizations have put in immense amount of effort to link various users accounts to their Aadhaar number and this has turned out to be very beneficial because it has reduced the processing time, reduced the leakage in the system and also eradicate the duplicity of account in sectors like LPG Subsidy, Academic Scholarship, Crop Insurance etc. Through this work, approaches involved in design and implementation of an Aadhaar based E Health application with OAuth is discussed.""""","Yes","""""A.

The various new privacy policies that have been put in place across different social media platforms, tend to take away the user's choice on whether they want their data shared with other social media apps or no. Seeing how WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram are all Facebook owned, any data shared across one platform crosses over with the database of another, regardless of whether you have an account or not, completely taking away from the concept of consensual sharing of data.
